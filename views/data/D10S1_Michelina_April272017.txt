question do you go to PA Cyber					00:17.3	00:17.9		yup				00:18.3	00:20.4	okay I saw you at pause filler the PSSAs					00:20.5	00:21.6		I knew you look familiar				00:21.6	00:22.5		I knew it				00:22.6	00:22.7	I know					00:23.0	00:24.1	I walked by the room					00:24.1	00:25.4	and I saw you through the window					00:25.4	00:27.3	I was like wait a minute					00:27.5	00:27.8		I know				00:28.7	00:30.9		because I knew I saw you before				00:30.9	00:33.6		I just never talked to you before				00:35.8	00:37.5	it was weird					00:41.4	00:43.6	it was like dej•À_ vu					00:43.6	00:44.7		I knew you look familiar				00:50.0	00:50.2		yay (laughter)				00:50.4	00:52.1	should I go to page one					00:52.1	00:54.5	because I'm on page two right now					00:54.7	00:58.4		pause filler mine is on top so let's go				00:58.4	00:58.5	okay					01:10.8	01:15.2	now we wait for tech stuff to get fixed					01:15.2	01:16.9		it's just like PA cyber				01:15.3	07:08.4			S1  			01:16.9	01:17.9	I know right					01:17.9	01:20.6	they like telling me how computers never worked					01:20.6	01:22.8	I'm like I'm in cyber school I know that					01:22.8	01:24.2	I know that by now					01:25.0	01:26.3	it's kind of obvious					01:26.4	01:29.0		how long have you been in PA Cyber		QE		01:29.0	01:30.9	pause filler two years I think				SD	01:30.9	01:32.0	no this is my third year				SD	01:32.5	01:33.0		cool				01:33.0	01:38.2	and before that I did another cyber school that wasn't as good (laughter)				SD	01:38.6	01:45.1	yeah but then I'm actually pause filler switching schools to like a private school next year				SD	01:45.2	01:46.3	so I won't be in anymore					01:47.0	01:48.1	how long have you been in it				QE	01:48.2	01:50.1		seven years which I'm seventh grade so		SD		01:50.4	01:50.9	wow					01:51.2	01:53.8		you never know (inaudible)				01:53.8	01:56.8	exactly because before that I was home schooled				SD	01:56.8	01:57.4	so it's like					01:57.4	01:59.3	it's not exactly cyber school					01:59.3	02:04.0	but it just (inaudible)					02:04.0	02:05.1	so do you take all virtuals				QE	02:05.7	02:05.9		yeah				02:05.9	02:13.1	okay I take two virtuals and like two self-paced which is self-pace kind of stick though				SD	02:13.1	02:14.9	I don't think there is as good as virtuals so				SD	02:15.0	02:18.2		yeah I think I did it like one year				02:18.3	02:20.0		and I didn't				02:20.0	02:23.0	yeah I think I just did it because					02:23.8	02:25.4	I don't know					02:25.4	02:26.1	I feel like (inaudible)					02:26.1	02:31.6	and I feel like that would be really boring like as a virtual				SD	02:31.6	02:32.7	but I think I'm wrong					02:33.4	02:40.8	no I always liked to see pause filler if people have the same teachers with me				SD	02:40.8	02:45.3	but I know it's like really really brighter like					02:45.3	02:46.3	what's your name				QE	02:46.5	02:46.8		Darby		SD		02:47.3	02:51.2	okay yeah I don't think I have any Darbys in any of my classes				SD	02:51.6	02:53.2		what grade are you in		QE		02:53.2	02:58.3	seventh yeah so we could have made in the same class but				SD	02:58.5	02:59.0		what's your name		QE		02:59.0	02:59.6		Jayel			SD	transcript in wrong tier02:59.6	03:04.1		I don't think I remember do you know one kid named Kinsley		QE		03:04.7	03:05.9	Kinsley nope I don't				SD	03:06.2	03:08.4		so I think she had a kid named Kale in the class				03:08.7	03:10.0		but I'm not sure				03:10.6	03:11.0	yeah					03:11.0	03:13.2		what all teachers have you had		QE		03:14.0	03:15.1	what teachers do I have					03:15.7	03:15.8		yeah				03:16.3	03:23.6	yeah pause filler right now I have Ms. Domingo and Ms. Frizzle which is really funny because Ms. Frizzle				SD	03:23.6	03:29.1	I always like joke around about it because you know like Ms. Frizzle from like the Magic School Bus or whatever				SD	03:29.1	03:29.5		yeah				03:29.5	03:31.6	it sounds just like that					03:31.7	03:32.5	it's really funny					03:33.4	03:36.8	and then all my English teachers have the weird names					03:36.8	03:39.8	like my English teacher before that her name was Ms. Azola				SD	03:39.8	03:44.1	and she was like oh what if I meet a soda company					03:44.1	03:46.0	and I get called Asolo Soda (laughter)					03:46.1	03:51.0	it was like oh all the English teachers with the weird names					03:51.3	03:54.4		mm-hmm I have Ms. Cunningham		SD		03:54.6	03:59.9	oh it's like I've ever had a Ms. Cunningham but yeah				SD	03:59.9	04:05.2	but you could have had in the class the other like last or a year before that					04:05.2	04:11.6	but you type your number every single person in your class					04:11.6	04:11.7		yeah				04:11.7	04:17.5	yeah it's true so they're the memorable ones					04:17.8	04:22.7	how long does it take to get a pair of pen sticks apparently a while					04:24.3	04:26.5		I don't know				04:26.5	04:27.8	I bet it makes sense to them					04:27.8	04:30.1	but I don't really understand why we're supposed to use Skype					04:30.1	04:31.8	it's normal for me though					04:31.8	04:32.8	because that's what I do					04:32.8	04:34.9	it's like classes are like Skype so it's					04:34.9	04:37.4		I've never used Skype ever (laughter)		SD		04:37.7	04:38.6	really yeah					04:38.6	04:41.3		all my friends have it				04:41.4	04:42.8	I don't use it a whole lot			SD		04:42.8	04:44.5	but I'm saying it's not like super different					04:44.5	04:49.7	because virtual classes do resemble Skype like at least now that we have the board up					04:49.9	04:56.6	because that's like the boarding class I think like the whiteboard or whatever whatever you call it					04:56.8	04:59.9		I would just call it screen				05:00.5	05:03.2	yeah the screen the screen you type all over					05:03.2	05:05.7		the screen of destiny (laughter)				05:06.3	05:10.0	the screen of learning what are you learning					05:10.0	05:11.4	dreams are destroyed					05:11.4	05:13.8	and you sit there and watch them from port on					05:14.1	05:14.9		yup				05:15.1	05:15.4	yup					05:18.1	05:24.7	I think I've made a heart					05:24.7	05:34.8	I think PA Cyber like you know the pads we draw on					05:34.8	05:35.7		the Bamboo pad				05:36.5	05:41.5	yeah these I think PA Cyber has ever has like something similar to it					05:41.5	05:41.7		yeah				05:42.1	05:43.3	yeah I think it					05:43.3	05:45.0		I had one but it broke				05:45.0	05:47.2	yeah I tried submitting up					05:47.2	05:48.7	and it was too confusing					05:48.7	05:51.2	and it didn't work after I was trying					05:51.2	05:52.3	and so I gave up					05:52.8	05:54.5		they might have given you the wrong pen				05:54.5	05:56.9		because I know you need to use the pen for it to on				05:56.9	06:00.1	yeah I mean I've heard (inaudible) mine was					06:00.1	06:04.0	but it was definitely smaller than this					06:04.1	06:06.3	and it didn't have all these buttons					06:06.3	06:10.1		I think that mine was like half size of this maybe				06:10.1	06:14.0	yeah it was like kind of this size and the part you actually write on					06:14.0	06:17.2	but it didn't have like this plastic frame or whatever					06:17.2	06:17.4		yeah				06:17.4	06:19.5	I don't know if you have the same one as me				0	i'm 50/50 because i don't know if it seems personal/enduring enough06:19.5	06:22.0	so I'm just hoping you understand what I'm talking about					06:22.0	06:22.1		yeah				06:24.2	06:29.3	I can't tell I'm pretty sure you're right there in that direction					06:29.8	06:31.8		yeah I don't know (laughter)				06:31.8	06:36.0	me neither I mean really like next to you because as I walked over					06:36.7	06:37.2		I saw you yeah				06:37.6	06:37.9	yeah					06:37.9	06:40.2		because I was like that girls is familiar				06:40.2	06:43.4	yeah could you see them list					06:43.4	06:45.0	I don't know what they're doing					06:45.4	06:46.4		I can't see from here so				06:46.8	06:48.9	yeah well they're like in the other room					06:48.9	06:50.0	but it's a clear wall					06:50.0	06:51.6	so I don't know what they're clinging right now					06:51.6	06:52.8	oh they're leaving again					06:52.8	06:53.6	oh well we still wait more					06:53.6	06:54.2	oh she's bringing a pen					06:54.2	06:55.0	maybe they're fixed					06:58.0	06:58.1	okay					07:08.6	07:11.6	do I have to pause filler hold this down					07:31.2	07:32.4	I can't hear that well					07:32.4	07:34.6	I just don't hold this					07:40.8	07:40.9	pause filler nope					07:44.5	07:48.4		is it the questions in the future to do				08:07.8	08:09.9		yeah I don't want to a little mess so (laughter)				08:37.7	08:40.1		that's twenty problems				08:46.2	08:48.5		nah okay what is oh I have this				08:50.3	08:51.9		I think so				08:54.6	08:55.8	that was me					08:59.2	09:02.1		oh my god another ah what the				09:08.0	09:10.1		here we go (laughter)				09:13.5	28:09.7			T1 			09:15.0	09:15.1		great				09:15.1	09:19.0	okay teach me					09:20.6	09:23.9		pause filler so do you see the x minus x equals thirteen				09:24.4	09:26.4	yup I see it same place you are					09:26.4	09:31.7		I'm guessing this is a question we're working on and I thought				09:31.7	09:33.6	yup pause filler just don't push the button					09:33.7	09:34.8	that's all I was told					09:35.1	09:35.3		yeah (laughter)				09:35.8	09:36.6	okay I'm ready					09:37.3	09:38.2		don't press anything				09:38.2	09:39.1		just solve the problem (laughter)				09:39.3	09:44.0		so I have no idea how to explain this (laughter)				09:44.7	09:45.3	it's okay					09:45.3	09:47.6	I already kind of understand this					09:47.6	09:48.7	so just do your best					09:49.8	09:53.0		what I know and do for this is just do the opposite (laughter)				09:54.3	09:57.6		so like if you do x minus six this is thirteen plus six				09:57.6	09:58.1		that's the answer				09:58.7	10:02.5	okay like the opposite operation all right should I do this					10:02.7	10:04.1	or should you do this					10:04.1	10:04.8		I think you (laughter)				10:05.0	10:05.3	okay					10:05.7	10:08.9		it's just a thirteen plus six I mean				10:09.0	10:12.6	this is hard to draw plus six okay					10:12.9	10:16.0		no that is okay				10:17.1	10:24.1	plus six so that would mean x equal to					10:24.1	10:27.8	that was a really bad equal to sign					10:27.8	10:29.5	I don't know what that is					10:30.1	10:36.3	I'm scared of it okay oh well nineteen					10:36.8	10:43.0	that's not a nine one minute okay wait					10:43.0	10:45.3	this is confusing					10:45.9	10:49.4	okay I think I got it now nineteen					10:49.4	10:51.2	there's my sloppy answer					10:51.8	10:55.2		so then you can like double check it by nineteen minus six equals				10:55.8	10:58.2	yeah that's a good trick okay					10:58.4	11:00.2	so I guess we'll move onto the next page now					11:00.2	11:01.3		I suppose				11:01.3	11:03.8		so let's see if I can do that while messing out				11:04.2	11:05.2	okay I'm on it					11:05.2	11:05.8	do you see it					11:05.8	11:07.4		yeah I'm trying to get down good				11:07.5	11:08.9		I am not good at this				11:09.2	11:12.1	okay just like okay do you see it					11:12.1	11:21.5	fifteen equals negative eight plus p or a q whatever					11:24.5	11:25.2		so (laughter)				11:25.2	11:28.1	are you on the first page or the second page					11:28.1	11:30.8		second I see fifteen equals minus eight equals p				11:31.3	11:31.5	okay					11:34.1	11:49.7		so I'm guessing I'll do achy nose achy nose ah (laughter) so just that like minus eight to each side I think				11:49.7	11:49.8	oh yeah					11:50.0	11:53.4		that's what I'm doing here				11:53.4	11:57.0	well at least minus negative eight yeah					11:57.2	12:00.5		yeah so add negative eight to both I suppose				12:01.0	12:04.5	yeah which is just basically just adding the (inaudible) no right					12:04.5	12:06.1		or no add eight to each				12:06.3	12:09.2		because eight minus eight equals eight equals zero so				12:09.7	12:14.6	so plus yeah because it should not be those like a positive					12:14.6	12:15.3	I think					12:15.8	12:16.6	I don't know					12:16.6	12:19.7		over or just a regular number plus a negative				12:20.1	12:29.4	yeah well if you're subtracting wait one second yeah because we're subtracting negative eight					12:29.6	12:37.3	which would make it just adding eight pause filler plus eight plus eight					12:37.3	12:39.5		what did you do to that				12:40.4	12:45.2	so that would make this side just p					12:46.4	12:50.5	and oh jeez this is confusing okay					12:51.1	12:59.7	and that would make this side ninety-three right yeah					13:01.0	13:04.7		yeah (laughter) the mental math there for a second				13:04.7	13:07.2	I'm really about it for some reason					13:07.3	13:08.7	I need to show me a flash cards					13:09.0	13:10.7	okay I'm on page three now					13:11.0	13:14.1	I'll wait for you actually okay					13:16.9	13:19.5		so seventeen I think				13:20.4	13:21.7		because you're trying to find the k				13:21.9	13:25.0		like what plus eleven would equal seventeen				13:25.5	13:25.9	yeah					13:26.4	13:28.1		so seventeen minus eleven				13:29.1	13:29.5	okay					13:29.5	13:31.0		then eleven minus eleven				13:32.0	13:34.2	yeah I would just do					13:34.2	13:45.9	you do one side to do on another side minus eleven to the side equals k					13:45.9	13:49.5	that looks like an r oops okay					13:50.3	13:57.4		well it doesn't have to be perfect just				13:57.4	13:58.6		it has to have the answer				13:58.8	14:01.3	yeah okay pause filler I'm sorry					14:01.4	14:03.1	I'm a perfectionist I (inaudible)					14:03.3	14:03.9		me too (inaudible)				14:06.0	14:08.0	okay six right okay					14:08.0	14:10.9		yup that's six equals				14:11.4	14:13.8	oops I skipped too many pages					14:13.8	14:15.8	all right I'm on page four					14:16.5	14:17.1		I got it too				14:17.8	14:19.2	is this like forty-four yeah					14:19.4	14:20.8	and this looks to be an x					14:21.2	14:25.0		forty-four x or forty-times one equals				14:25.8	14:26.1	yeah					14:26.5	14:28.2		wait x stands as a multiplication sign				14:28.2	14:30.2		and that the same thing is				14:30.2	14:36.5	yeah but I'm thinking if in algebra they would use this sign that circle					14:36.5	14:37.5		they don't use a sign				14:37.9	14:39.2		they just make you pretty much				14:39.2	14:40.6		they put the letters together				14:40.6	14:45.3		so that's forty-four x equals forty-time whatever				14:45.3	14:50.0		it equal so two hundred and twenty divided by forty-four pretty much				14:50.0	14:52.3	this is what you want to do okay					14:52.8	14:53.4		I think				14:53.4	14:56.3	usually (inaudible) like you're teaching me so I'm going to try this I think					14:56.3	14:57.3		I just used the opposite				14:57.3	15:00.2		because the opposite of multiplication is division I mean				15:00.2	15:03.5	yeah but then you have to make sure you're doing it to both sides					15:03.5	15:06.7	because the goal is to cancel the variable out					15:08.4	15:10.9	so I don't think					15:10.9	15:13.3	I know this is depressing					15:13.3	15:18.4	and I'm going to have to write this out					15:18.4	15:21.4		I can't help you if you want I mean				15:21.4	15:23.6	okay you want to do the whole division					15:23.6	15:27.5	that's my weakness for all things					15:27.5	15:29.1	like I'm good with concepts					15:29.1	15:32.0	but like computation I'm slow at it					15:32.0	15:34.9		oh my gosh I suck at writing this thing				15:35.4	15:51.0	yeah it's kind of hard					15:51.0	15:55.0		(sfx) (laughter) oh so pretty much forty-four will go and not going to do				15:55.2	15:57.4		forty-four wouldn't go into twenty-two so				15:57.8	15:59.4	yeah you got to do it					15:59.4	16:00.2		zero equals				16:00.2	16:01.4	two twenty					16:01.4	16:05.8		zero where is the calculator (laughter)				16:05.8	16:07.1	I don't know					16:07.1	16:09.8	wait there's a bunch of other tools					16:09.8	16:11.8	but we weren't told what those are					16:11.8	16:14.8	so I'm guessing we're not supposed to use this					16:14.9	16:20.4		I wonder if I'm allowed to use this scratch paper				16:20.4	16:20.9	pause filler I don't know					16:20.9	16:24.2	(inaudible) I'm pretty sure they want us to do it on the screen					16:24.2	16:24.5	I don't know					16:24.5	16:25.8		I know this is hard				16:26.3	16:30.5	to stay for later					16:30.6	16:32.5		so they're coming				16:32.5	16:40.6	here I think I'm at two					16:40.6	16:44.0		(laughter) eighty-eight				16:43.0	16:44.0	(inaudible)					16:44.7	16:46.3	hey that's forty-four					16:46.3	16:49.9	yeah use your pause filler actual pen like you can					16:49.9	17:26.0		yeah one twenty-two nope that's twenty-five I think				17:26.0	17:26.2	okay					17:26.2	17:33.5		I'm looking for an assembly in this thing				17:34.0	17:34.1	okay					17:34.1	17:37.9		okay yeah currently we're doing it right pause filler (laughter)				17:38.0	17:39.9	okay pause filler I can't tell if I'm in the frame					17:39.9	17:44.0	because there's a warning sign like covering me up					17:44.0	17:45.9	so sorry if you can't see me					17:45.9	17:46.8		yeah you're right in the middle				17:46.8	17:47.6		so am I				17:47.6	17:49.4	okay good yeah you're good					17:49.4	17:52.0		cool I might need over here a little bit				17:52.0	17:55.1		but that's just because I'm looking at those				17:55.1	17:55.2	okay					17:55.2	18:02.6		so yeah like do you think what I have is like twelve equals twenty-four so				18:02.6	18:04.9		and I'm just going twelve over twelve				18:04.9	18:07.4	yeah that's like basically what ours is					18:09.1	18:12.2	so do we do it right so far at least the dividing by forty-four					18:12.6	18:12.8		yeah				18:12.9	18:13.0	okay					18:13.0	18:17.2		that's just pretty much how many time forty-four				18:17.2	18:18.0		I can go with that				18:18.6	18:26.1	okay okay so forty-four plus forty-four it's eighty-eight and then eighty-eight					18:26.5	18:28.0	that's forty-four					18:28.6	18:30.4	is there a faster way to do this					18:30.7	18:33.9		I wish calculator up (laughter)				18:33.9	18:34.4	yeah					18:34.4	18:44.0		one seventy-six equals forty-four				18:45.4	18:46.9	here okay					18:48.1	18:50.5		another four so far so				18:51.5	18:54.0	okay yeah you're closer than I am					18:54.0	18:55.7	so I guess I'll wait					19:06.4	19:07.9		I got it				19:08.1	19:09.2	yeah okay how much is it					19:09.6	19:12.4		so for me I just want the (inaudible) though (laughter)				19:12.4	19:13.2	okay what do you					19:13.2	19:30.6		so I think it's either five or six I'm fine with				19:30.6	19:37.0	why would it seems more reasonable					19:40.1	19:40.6		five				19:41.0	19:44.8	okay so five go right here					19:44.8	19:48.5	and how many five times was it exactly					19:49.6	19:52.7	do you remember what five times forty-four was					19:53.6	19:54.5		I'm double-checking that now				19:54.5	19:54.6	okay					19:54.6	20:09.1		four five let me see (laughter) sounds like make				20:09.1	20:20.8		and now it will work pause filler (laughter)				20:20.8	20:25.2	you do write it down as we're doing the problem is what I'm asking					20:25.2	20:27.9	and did it fit into it exactly					20:27.9	20:30.9	because if it did then it's two hundred and twenty					20:31.2	20:33.7		because I just went like forty-four (inaudible) pause filler				20:38.6	20:41.0		yeah I need to talk				20:41.4	20:45.1		oh add twenty-five great job				20:45.8	20:47.2	there we go it's back					20:47.6	20:50.7		so I just went like forty-four plus forty-four equals eighty-eight				20:50.8	20:53.1		so I want eighty-eight plus eighty-eight which would be four				20:53.1	20:54.7		then I added another forty-four so				20:54.7	21:03.5	so the fifth one the fifth forty-four that you added what you end up with was that exactly two hundred and twenty					21:04.3	21:05.7		yeah I'm still checking it now one sec				21:05.7	21:11.2	okay because if it was then we can just write two hundred twenty					21:11.2	21:13.0	and then you're left with no remainder					21:13.0	21:16.3	and so your answer is that's					21:16.7	21:20.3	I don't know what I did					21:21.1	21:26.9	so then the answer would be five if it fits exactly is what I'm saying					21:26.9	21:28.4		I think it's five so				21:28.4	21:31.2	yeah because you'd subtract this					21:31.3	21:32.4	I don't know what I'm doing					21:32.4	21:35.1		I keep messing up on pens my pen				21:36.0	21:41.0	okay so that one would be five right yeah					21:41.0	21:45.6		x equals five maybe (laughter) we hope				21:45.6	21:48.5	we think let's just move on					21:49.0	21:53.0	(inaudible) (laughter)					21:53.1	22:01.3	okay I think I get how to do this					22:01.3	22:04.2	just tell me like what comes to nine					22:04.2	22:09.8	or how you would explain how to do it					22:10.4	22:17.4		I'm trying to find the specific thing over here (inaudible) (laughter)				22:17.4	22:18.9	oh my gosh					22:19.3	22:32.0		oh my god (laughter) okay so (inaudible) so we can start this problem				22:32.1	22:35.1		but pause filler (laughter) I have no clue what I'm doing				22:35.5	22:39.6	I don't know if I'm supposed to help you					22:39.6	22:40.6	or like if I know it					22:40.7	22:42.5	I don't know if I'm supposed to help you					22:42.5	22:45.4	or wait until I'm tutoring you					22:45.4	22:46.5	I'm not sure					22:46.5	22:47.7		right now I'm tutoring you				22:47.7	22:49.4		so I guess I know what I'm doing				22:49.5	22:53.9	yeah so I guess I'll just listen hands off					22:55.5	22:58.8		I'm trying to solve it my mind first to see if I get it that's all				22:59.0	23:02.4	yeah well you can write it down as you go if you want					23:02.4	23:05.0		like I don't think there's anything wrong with that				23:05.0	23:15.3		I have memorial hands on stuck on my hand				23:15.3	23:16.6	I know I feel like coming					23:16.6	23:20.2	and I'm like wait everyone there's a mic on me					23:20.5	23:21.5	I probably shouldn't					23:27.5	23:32.4		(laughter) (inaudible) so I guess you'd have to cross cancel the negative number				23:32.5	23:32.9	yeah					23:33.8	23:42.0		so like minus nine plus nine and then forty-one plus nine				23:42.9	23:43.6	okay					23:43.6	23:43.9		maybe (laughter)				23:43.9	23:44.9	so you want to write that					23:44.9	23:47.2	or do you want me to					23:47.2	23:48.5		pause filler you because you're a lot better at this (laughter)				23:48.6	23:50.0		you're a lot better at writing				23:50.0	23:53.3	okay so you say what do you want me to write again					23:53.3	23:56.2		it's like cross cancel this one				23:56.3	23:58.7	so cancel out the negative nine is what you're saying					23:58.7	23:59.7		yeah pretty much				23:59.7	24:05.7	okay so you would do add negative nine					24:05.7	24:12.3	and you have to do that to each side right					24:12.3	24:13.5		I think				24:14.9	24:17.3	I'm sorry I don't want to like					24:17.4	24:22.9		I'm looking at them				24:22.9	24:24.5	okay now what does it say to do					24:24.5	24:27.9	or what do you want me to do					24:27.9	24:32.0		I guess when you kind of divide				24:32.0	24:36.2		because you're doing thirteen p which is thirteen times p				24:36.3	24:38.0	yeah so					24:38.1	24:42.5		it's like divided by five				24:42.5	24:46.7		or for us it would be thirteen so forty-one divided by thirteen and thirteen divided thirteen				24:46.7	24:48.3	I'm trying to write on this					24:50.7	24:53.4	so that's yeah okay					24:54.6	24:56.7	so we should probably do this					24:57.1	24:59.2	because I wrote it down					24:59.2	25:00.2	but we didn't actually do it					25:00.8	25:06.0	so we're left with thirteen oh my gosh					25:06.0	25:14.5	so after we do the first step you told me to do					25:14.7	25:24.1	I get thirteen p equals forty-one					25:24.1	25:26.3	after that we were					25:26.8	25:29.3		well you have to add nine to forty-one				25:29.5	25:32.1		so that would technically be fifty now				25:32.1	25:32.9	oh right you're right					25:32.9	25:36.7	I forgot to do that					25:39.6	25:41.3	see this is what tutors are for					25:41.3	25:44.0	it remind you skip something yeah					25:44.0	25:50.8	so I'm adding negative nine which is basically just subtracting nine right					25:51.8	25:53.6		well you're adding nine				25:53.6	25:56.9		because minus nine wouldn't if you subtracted it it would be				25:58.4	25:59.5	so you want me to add nine					25:59.6	26:03.2		minus fifteen so minus nine plus nine and then forty-one plus nine				26:03.7	26:04.3	so fifty					26:05.0	26:05.3		yeah				26:05.4	26:07.0	is that what you're saying okay so					26:07.0	26:08.7		the hand minus				26:08.7	26:11.0	okay (inaudible) that to make it fifty					26:12.6	26:16.7	pause filler that's a really bad fifty but what we're doing and then					26:16.8	26:21.4		so then thirteen p you have to divide thirteen by forty-one				26:21.9	26:23.5	yeah this is getting really crooked					26:23.6	26:26.4	you have to tilt your head to see it					26:26.4	26:27.0	but that's okay					26:27.0	26:28.0	(inaudible)					26:32.2	26:38.3	yeah so then that gives us p equals					26:38.5	26:54.7	how many time does thirteen go into fifty and fifteen twenty-six right fifteen twenty-six thirty-nine twenty-two forty-five					26:54.7	26:56.2		you can go to forty-two				26:57.2	27:02.0		but then if you add forty-two plus thirteen it will be forty-five so				27:02.4	27:04.7	yeah so that's four right					27:04.7	27:04.7		yeah				27:04.9	27:06.0	okay so					27:07.1	27:08.1		so you have a remainder				27:09.5	27:11.3	yeah but I'm pretty sure					27:11.3	27:14.0	like with the problems that I did on the paper it is simplified					27:15.2	27:18.4	so I don't know what they want me to do					27:18.4	27:21.4	oh I can see myself now					27:21.4	27:22.9	okay now I can't					27:23.0	27:24.2	it went back					27:24.2	27:25.8	now I can see the tip of my head					27:25.8	27:26.4	so I could not (inaudible)					27:26.4	27:29.8	I think we just leave it at that right					27:30.8	27:34.9	or should we add the remainder or write down the remainder					27:36.9	27:40.7		well the remainder would be pause filler eight so				27:41.4	27:43.4	can I just like write r					27:44.3	27:45.1	this is what I					27:45.1	27:46.6		yeah that's before eight				27:46.9	27:49.0	this is what I was taught to do					27:49.0	27:51.7	I don't know if (inaudible) this right page six					27:52.8	27:53.7	this is similar					27:53.7	27:55.6		an easy one				27:55.7	27:55.8	yeah					27:56.1	28:06.3		so got to start making this got to start making (laughter) pause filler (inaudible)				28:10.7	28:10.8	hello					28:17.6	28:23.8	do you want me to					28:24.9	28:25.1	okay					28:28.8	28:29.4	okay					28:37.0	28:37.5	okay					28:51.2	28:51.6	okay					29:02.0	29:02.1		yay				29:12.1	29:12.5		kind of				29:15.6	29:16.7		I'm not sure				29:17.1	29:18.5		I'm might have to ask mom				29:19.4	29:20.7		because I know like it stuck majorly				29:20.8	29:22.7		but I'm not sure how it will come out				29:28.3	29:29.7		well I have springs though fun				29:33.1	29:33.4		yeah (laughter)				29:44.0	29:44.3		I'm good				29:46.7	29:49.3	I don't want to eat mine in front of you then					29:49.5	29:51.2		I'm good you go ahead				29:51.2	29:55.4	okay I don't want to be					29:53.2	34:29.1			S2 			29:55.6	29:56.4	so now we've made again					29:56.4	29:58.5	that was it that was it (inaudible)					29:58.5	30:01.5	I thought it would be like a stuff I didn't know				SD	30:01.8	30:03.2	but I knew it				SD	30:03.2	30:04.3	and you were the teacher so					30:04.3	30:07.9		I'm not a good teacher			SD	30:08.4	30:15.1	because like what if I'm usually that					30:15.1	30:18.3	so when I find that I was going to do					30:18.3	30:20.0	so I was looking					30:20.0	30:21.1	oh I'm like bad at math				SD	30:21.1	30:22.8	this isn't going to be good					30:22.8	30:25.4	and then I thought well actually it's probably help to					30:25.4	30:26.6	like I'm bad at math					30:26.8	30:31.2	because then I can figure out how to teach so many bit if they are anyway but					30:31.2	30:32.2		it is nine o two p.m. pause filler				30:32.2	30:35.9	really mine says eight twenty-five twenty-four					30:35.9	30:36.9		mine says nine o two				30:37.0	30:38.0	pause filler well					30:38.9	30:40.6		who's right				30:40.7	30:43.4	I got here seventy thirty					30:44.2	30:46.2	I don't think we have been here for an hour and a half					30:46.2	30:47.5	I don't know					30:47.5	30:47.9		I don't know				30:48.6	30:51.4	let's compromise and stay in the middle					30:51.5	30:51.8		yeah (laughter)				30:51.9	31:00.8	oh no it fell					31:04.1	31:05.4	pause filler is there a trash					31:07.2	31:10.3	oh well just leave it there for now					31:10.5	31:22.7		thirty-second rule (laughter) I don't know why my eye keep twitching				31:22.7	31:23.4	mm-hmm I mean (inaudible) the screen					31:24.2	31:27.2		this is like the one eye sort of twitch (inaudible)				31:28.0	31:29.2	huh that's weird					31:29.8	31:32.0		my bangs are long				31:32.0	31:33.8		I don't know				31:33.8	31:40.1	do you usually like wear glasses				QE	31:40.1	31:43.9	because that makes no sense					31:43.0	31:43.9		(inaudible)				31:43.9	31:44.0		no				31:44.9	31:46.1		my eyes twitches sometimes		SD		31:46.1	31:46.4		I noticed				31:47.3	31:54.9	yeah it's not like something major like going partially blind or something					31:55.0	31:56.2	so I wouldn't be worried about it					31:56.2	31:56.3		ah (laughter)				31:56.7	31:57.8	my eye is twitching					31:57.8	32:00.1	somebody call the ambulance					32:00.1	32:01.2	it's just a twitch					32:01.2	32:01.6		yeah I know				32:01.6	32:02.7		it's not (inaudible)				32:03.1	32:04.6		it's just annoying				32:05.1	32:07.1		yeah I have no idea what to do right now				32:07.1	32:07.4	me neither					32:07.8	32:24.4		this is like standing in a room with somebody you know				32:24.9	32:27.3		it's just like what do I do				32:27.3	32:29.7	you're not even standing in a room					32:29.7	32:31.9	we're in different rooms					32:31.9	32:34.5		it's like what do we do				32:34.6	32:35.4		I know it's just				32:35.4	32:36.1	like I'm not going to do this					32:36.1	32:37.5	but (inaudible) on that wall and you could hear me					32:37.5	32:39.0	because I'm pretty sure you're in that room					32:39.1	32:39.9	I could be wrong					32:40.7	32:41.6		(laughter) I'll scream				32:41.6	32:45.8	I'm pretty sure we just hear each other (inaudible)					32:45.8	32:46.0		yeah				32:46.0	32:48.1	I have headphone					32:48.6	32:51.9		I don't really know				32:55.4	32:56.6	okay we could ask questions					32:57.0	32:59.3	like whenever there's a new year it appears					32:59.3	33:03.5	we would have these like me like each other					33:03.5	33:08.5	and they ask questions that you usually wouldn't ask in real life but					33:08.6	33:08.7		oh god				33:08.7	33:13.8	and people like okay now I can't even think of the questions				SD	33:13.8	33:20.3	but they're just commonly questions like what's your favorite subject or what are your hobbies but					33:20.3	33:20.6		oh yeah				33:21.9	33:25.9	and it's not like people walk up to you					33:26.2	33:27.7	what it's your term paper					33:27.7	33:29.6	it's a cool subject (laughter)					33:29.6	33:33.2		I really don't know why people think that				33:33.2	33:36.1		like it's cool to say like how's your school				33:36.1	33:39.5		and I'm like I sat here bored as always what's				33:40.1	33:40.3	yeah					33:40.4	33:42.9		this is like we're expected to be				33:43.2	33:45.6		people don't just stop by pause filler (laughter)				33:45.6	33:51.6	well yeah I'm like pretty constant					33:51.6	33:52.7	so then you ask					33:53.1	33:55.1	and they ask is there anything new in school					33:55.1	34:01.2	and you're like no probably never will be until I hit like the hard stuff					34:01.4	34:03.9	like high school that would be new					34:03.9	34:05.8		yeah that would be fun				34:05.8	34:09.5	yeah kind of new					34:09.5	34:12.9		so bad my grades this year I'm going to (inaudible)		SD		with how bad my grades are this year i'm not gonna do good34:12.9	34:17.9		I have a C in math others are all As		SD		34:19.1	34:21.6	I'm about teach you so it will be okay					34:21.6	34:26.8		it's really because I got a really bad grade in the first quarter		SD		34:26.8	34:31.1		and then you're just trying to work that up				34:31.1	34:31.4		I've got an 80%		SD		34:39.4	34:42.6	I don't want to like whither					34:55.8	34:57.2	just telling her on what to do					35:05.1	35:13.2	okay should I pause filler like should I tell her like what to do and have her like solve it or					35:13.4	35:14.5	I'm not really sure					35:26.5	35:26.5	yeah					35:26.9	35:27.4	okay					35:31.4	54:02.8			T2			35:31.8	35:32.1	okay					35:32.2	35:32.8		(laughter) your own (inaudible)				35:33.1	35:40.2	yeah okay so pause filler what you always want to make sure is that the variable is on one side					35:40.2	35:42.2	because it just makes it easier					35:42.3	35:46.4	and I always split it down the middle on the equals sign like that					35:46.4	35:48.2	I don't know why					35:48.3	35:52.4	it just makes it easier to like know what to do to one side (inaudible)					35:52.4	35:58.5	and so what would your first guess be when you want to do this					35:59.5	36:01.7	because they said not to give you the answers					36:01.8	36:03.4	so I don't want to just do it					36:03.6	36:08.1		I'm just working on my head that's all				36:09.3	36:09.4	okay					36:10.0	36:10.2		(inaudible) so				36:11.9	36:12.1	yeah					36:14.2	36:16.6		oh (inaudible) what is going on				36:17.4	36:19.0		I'm not touching the board				36:19.1	36:21.2		why is it typing				36:21.2	36:24.1	yeah it might do that if you're hovering over it					36:24.4	36:24.8	I'm not sure					36:24.8	36:26.1		oh if you press these buttons I get it				36:26.3	36:27.8	okay wait a minute I'm sorry					36:27.8	36:29.5	I undoed everything					36:29.5	36:33.2		it's fine I don't know it anyway				36:34.4	36:36.7		I don't know if you cork this button				36:36.7	36:37.5	so basically					36:37.5	36:38.0		ah I could not				36:38.4	36:40.6	I'm pretty sure you have the right idea					36:40.6	36:44.0	because I could kind of hear you working it out					36:44.0	36:49.5		my pen is writing				36:49.5	36:53.9		oh hit the button people used to (inaudible) again				36:54.8	36:54.8	yeah					36:54.8	36:59.5		well at least not				37:00.1	37:01.5	pause filler it's not working for me either					37:01.5	37:04.9		I don't understand				37:04.9	37:08.0	oh well you know what I think it's something					37:08.0	37:09.1	(inaudible)					37:09.1	37:11.3	just ignore it yeah					37:11.5	37:14.8		and cross goodbye I don't want you				37:14.8	37:18.4		so minus three plus three equals zero (laughter)				37:18.4	37:25.6		twenty-five plus three equals twenty-five twenty-five plus three half				37:25.6	37:30.0		so now what so that would be x equals no no				37:30.0	37:34.2	how about you add it out like step by step					37:34.3	37:35.5	that might help					37:36.0	37:37.1	it's what I always do					37:38.8	37:48.9	so the goal is to try to cancel out pause filler all of the like coefficient yeah the coefficient which is					37:50.1	37:54.1	basically you want to cancel out all the constants on this side					37:54.3	37:58.7	and then yeah that's basically what you want to do					37:58.7	38:02.3		so minus three would have to disappear				38:02.3	38:04.3		so minus three plus three equals zero				38:04.7	38:06.9		twenty-five plus three equals twenty-five				38:07.1	38:09.4		twenty-five why did you say twenty-five plus twenty-five well no				38:09.6	38:10.7	no twenty-two (laughter)					38:10.7	38:12.2		eight equals twenty-five				38:12.2	38:12.7		that's all right now				38:12.8	38:17.1	okay so you're saying x equals what					38:17.8	38:18.7		twenty-five yeah because				38:19.4	38:21.0	twenty-five let me put that					38:21.1	38:24.6		then you can add twenty-five plus minus three which would be yeah				38:25.0	38:27.9	yeah wait one second (inaudible) out of my head					38:27.9	38:30.0		oh what did I do				38:30.0	38:31.2	do you want me oh					38:31.2	38:32.4	I'm trying to write it					38:32.4	38:33.6	but it's not working					38:34.7	38:40.5		(inaudible) press the button oh my god				38:41.4	38:45.0		that is the worst thing I've ever done				38:45.0	38:48.5		and that (inaudible) up with my handwriting twenty-five				38:48.5	38:49.9	there you can tell it's okay					38:49.9	38:54.4		yay no next one I suppose				38:56.2	39:02.4	okay so same thing go down the middle					39:03.2	39:04.5	try to get					39:04.7	39:14.2	cancel out all the pause filler numbers or I guess anything that's not a variable on this side					39:14.2	39:16.9	wait you call those constants right yeah constants					39:16.9	39:17.8		I think so				39:18.8	39:20.2	yeah constants and variables					39:23.6	39:31.1		so we'd have to get rid of eighteen				39:31.6	39:32.7		eighteen's got to go				39:33.1	39:37.9	yeah so the opposite operation so eighteen is being added which means you were					39:37.9	39:40.4		so eighteen minus eighteen equals zero				39:40.8	39:45.4		twenty-five minus eighteen equals five				39:46.0	39:47.5	okay so					39:50.1	39:51.8		so yeah it would be five				39:51.8	39:54.1		plus twenty-three minus eighteen equals five				39:54.8	40:00.7	so five and I certain times like draw it on the line like that					40:00.7	40:02.8	I don't know why I do that					40:03.3	40:05.5	it's like so then to the two sides too					40:05.5	40:13.2		okay so eighteen minus eight eighteen or (laughter) I can't talk				40:14.0	40:15.2	so you said five					40:15.2	40:17.6	I guess I don't know what a negative y would be					40:17.6	40:19.2	I guess it just be negative y					40:19.3	40:22.4	like I don't know if you have to do anything like that					40:22.4	40:28.1	I guess it's done					40:30.1	40:30.3		so (inaudible)				40:30.4	40:32.3	are you on page three					40:32.7	40:33.4		yup				40:33.4	40:37.0	I'm confused okay let me see					40:38.1	40:41.9	wait a minute okay it's not as bad as I think					40:41.9	40:47.9	there's just a lot of negatives so oh okay					40:47.9	40:53.9	so the other side you want me the variable on one side					40:53.9	40:54.4		yeah				40:54.7	41:00.2	so to do that you have to what kind of sheet is that is that					41:00.2	41:02.2	you have to add					41:02.2	41:04.9	so see at once negative or one is a positive					41:06.0	41:11.6	so let's say if you add one to each side you cannot see that					41:11.6	41:14.3	but oh well you add one to each side					41:16.2	41:19.5	then that's cancelling out this one					41:20.1	41:25.2	pause filler right here that's right yeah					41:25.4	41:26.8	oh it's cancelling out this one					41:26.8	41:28.8	so this is like comes zero					41:28.8	41:29.7	it's nothing					41:30.3	41:33.8	it's just fourteen now					41:35.1	41:39.2	pause filler and then this one becomes two okay					41:39.2	41:42.3	and then you do it from there					41:42.3	41:44.6	so I'm going to write out the problem for you now					41:44.7	41:45.8	because it's all messy					41:46.8	41:55.6	so fourteen equals thirty-six plus two					41:55.6	41:57.0	okay so you solve that					41:57.2	42:05.0		should two be multiplied by k				42:05.0	42:07.6	right now it's being multiplied by k yes so					42:07.6	42:12.1		I don't know how anything multiplied by how				42:12.1	42:16.4		it would have to be a negative number				42:16.4	42:20.6		because you'd have to kind of get fourteen out of thirty-six				42:21.8	42:24.5	yeah do you want me to split down the middle for you					42:24.5	42:26.1	I don't know if that helps you					42:26.1	42:27.4	but it helps me					42:28.7	42:30.0	sorry if it doesn't help you					42:30.0	42:37.5	it's like I always just choose a random start					42:37.5	42:42.2	so you can either start out thirty-six or start at two k					42:42.3	42:47.1	but either way you're trying to cancel out all of the constants					42:47.1	42:50.2	so we start at two k two					42:50.2	42:52.8	it's being multiplied by k					42:53.2	42:58.0	and so you would do the opposite pause filler operation					42:58.6	43:00.7		so fourteen divided by two				43:00.7	43:00.8	huh					43:01.2	43:02.2		so fourteen divided by two				43:02.5	43:08.4	yes fourteen divided by two					43:08.4	43:09.0		seven				43:09.4	43:12.0	seven okay					43:12.5	43:12.9		seven				43:14.5	43:15.9	I think I'm writing all this					43:15.9	43:17.0	but you're still doing the work					43:17.0	43:18.9	so I don't want them to think I was doing all this					43:18.9	43:21.3	because you're telling me this what to write down					43:21.3	43:24.2		no I'm just really bad at writing that's all				43:24.2	43:26.1	yeah I think down yeah					43:26.1	43:27.8		so then (inaudible) I think I hope				43:27.8	43:34.0	yeah I just don't want to watch this and (inaudible) and be like oh that girl didn't teach her anything					43:34.0	43:37.6	she just did all the work all right					43:37.9	43:40.4	and so seven and what would the other side be					43:45.6	43:46.4		pause filler minus seven maybe				43:46.4	43:48.8	oh wait why did I degrade at seven					43:48.8	43:51.6	oh wait because it is seven sorry					43:52.3	43:56.1		I just don't get how anything plus thirty-six can equal fourteen				43:56.6	43:56.8	huh					43:57.1	43:57.6		unless it's negative				43:57.6	43:59.6	yeah so the entire thing is like					44:00.1	44:02.3	that's what I want to think about logically					44:02.3	44:07.8	but sometimes like pause filler you can if you just follow like the rules					44:07.8	44:10.6	and you understand the rules now					44:10.6	44:12.0	but we all have different ways of thinking					44:12.0	44:13.9	like some people are just like this is the rule					44:13.9	44:14.6	and you follow this					44:14.7	44:18.3	and we're like well logically that doesn't make sense like that's like					44:18.3	44:21.6	I was like well logically like when I was writing negatives and stuff					44:21.6	44:23.1	I was like logically it would be this					44:23.1	44:25.7	and then they're like nope because this rules is this					44:25.7	44:26.8	so it actually will be this					44:27.8	44:30.9	yeah so there are stuff like this					44:30.9	44:31.9	I just follow					44:31.9	44:33.5	I have the certain set of rules					44:33.5	44:34.2	and I follow them					44:34.2	44:37.3	and that is what you do to one side you do to the other					44:38.0	44:44.1	so we divided fourteen by two					44:44.1	44:45.6	so I divide this by two					44:46.2	44:48.3	pause filler I messed something up					44:48.3	44:54.4		what would be two divided by two				44:54.6	44:54.7	huh					44:54.7	44:57.8		two divided by two would equal to zero so fourteen divided two				44:57.8	45:01.2	yeah two divided two so which means we're just left with					45:01.2	45:03.8	yeah we're just left with seven equals					45:04.2	45:05.1		thirty-six				45:05.1	45:08.7	thirty-six but we still have plus k					45:08.7	45:10.2	because we just cancelled out the two					45:10.2	45:11.5	we didn't cancel out the k					45:13.2	45:18.3		so we have to get one of this thirty-six or seven				45:19.0	45:21.8	no thirty-six because seven yeah					45:22.3	45:28.0		so thirty-six minus thirty-six equals zero so seven minus thirty-six				45:28.6	45:30.2	yup exactly					45:32.4	45:35.0		well equal minus twenty-nine				45:35.0	45:35.1		hmm				45:35.8	45:36.6		negative twenty-nine				45:36.9	45:38.3	yup so negative					45:38.6	45:40.2		negative twenty-nine equals k				45:41.0	45:42.1	yup we did it					45:42.1	45:43.4	I don't think we really have to write it out					45:43.5	45:45.5	pause filler let's do let's write that out					45:46.1	45:54.2	negative twenty-nine equals pause filler k oh well					45:54.2	45:58.2	okay are you on page four					45:58.3	45:58.4		yup				45:58.6	46:15.4	okay so this is like very similar so last time when we want the variables on one side last time when they were on two sides					46:15.4	46:16.4	do you remember what we did					46:17.4	46:17.6		yeah				46:18.3	46:22.4	yeah so do you want me to write it					46:22.4	46:25.3		yeah you're better at writing it I'm not good				46:25.3	46:29.0	okay so what shall we do first					46:30.1	46:31.3		we get rid of the p				46:32.4	46:40.5	yeah by canceling it out adding b but what we do to one side we have to do it to the next					46:40.8	46:42.9		so b plus b equals b (laughter)				46:43.8	46:48.8	so let's just pause filler write it out again over here					46:49.4	47:03.8	so seven seventeen sorry equals eighteen plus two b					47:04.0	47:09.1		would b we're getting rid off because this one the seventeen minus b				47:09.2	47:11.7		that one could stay but the thirteen plus b				47:11.7	47:14.4		I think we should get rid of that one				47:14.5	47:15.6	well you could it either way					47:15.6	47:17.0	I think you could pause filler					47:17.7	47:20.2	actually I don't think you could do it either way					47:20.5	47:25.9	because we need to trans like I guess					47:26.1	47:28.1		I got it I got it on my mind				47:28.1	47:31.8	it's really hard to explain if you want it					47:31.9	47:34.1	I don't think you could keep the minus b					47:34.1	47:43.9	because if you want it to minus that one if you want to do to minus b minus b you just be locked with like negative b					47:43.9	47:48.7	I don't really know I don't think it works so					47:48.7	47:53.6		I guess I have to go two time two or we never mind				47:53.8	47:57.1		we have to get rid of thirteen so				47:57.5	47:59.3	yeah you can do whatever first					47:59.3	48:01.6		thirteen minus thirteen equals zero				48:02.1	48:05.2		seventeen minus thirteen equals four so				48:05.3	48:06.6	so let's get I don't know why					48:06.7	48:11.4	I like to scribble this out but just so					48:11.4	48:12.6	what did you say four					48:14.5	48:19.2		yeah four because three plus four equals thirteen				48:19.8	48:23.5		I don't know				48:23.5	48:26.5	minus thirteen equals four					48:26.5	48:37.5	I'm just going to rewrite this because yeah okay					48:37.5	48:39.5	so here's what we have left					48:39.5	48:45.4		well so we must be going four divide it				48:45.4	48:48.9		because two times b equals four				48:48.9	48:50.5		so we go four divided by two				48:50.5	48:52.2		it would be two				48:52.8	48:54.1	yeah so					48:54.5	48:55.6		so two equals b				48:55.6	48:59.3	yup b equals two					48:59.3	49:00.5	that's not a two					49:00.5	49:01.7		that's an eight				49:02.6	49:04.4	that's now it's kind of a two					49:04.4	49:05.4	I don't know					49:05.4	49:08.3	I draw away in twos you know what whatever					49:08.3	49:11.6	you can see it like above it that					49:11.6	49:12.4	it's four					49:12.4	49:13.0		it's on recording (laughter)				49:13.2	49:16.3	yeah we're saying it					49:16.4	49:19.1		minus nine it (inaudible) so				49:20.0	49:22.1	this thing is easier I think					49:22.1	49:22.2		yeah				49:23.2	49:24.2	yeah this is easier					49:24.2	49:26.1		so one divided by nine				49:26.2	49:30.0	I think it's only one step mm-hmm					49:30.0	49:34.5	so divided by but you would divide it by negative nine right					49:34.5	49:35.0		yeah but				49:35.2	49:37.8	yeah negative nine pause filler					49:38.0	49:39.3		well can you go negative nine that's all				49:39.3	49:40.8		that is just add minus nine				49:51.6	49:58.7		so nine times nine would equal eighty-one				49:58.7	50:05.3		so nine divided by nine or eighty-one divided by nine would be nine				50:06.3	50:06.5	okay					50:07.9	50:09.3		or minus nine (laughter) in this case				50:09.5	50:14.3	yeah right we would add the minus					50:14.5	50:17.3	okay that was quick good job					50:18.0	50:18.3		okay okay				50:18.3	50:21.3	this one's longer					50:21.7	50:22.5		man				50:22.5	50:24.2	okay so now we do no					50:24.6	50:28.0	all right the variable is still on one side					50:29.8	50:29.9		yeah				50:30.7	50:30.9	oh okay					50:31.8	50:34.3		so we get rid of the ten				50:34.9	50:36.7		so ten minus ten equals zero				50:36.7	50:39.4		eighty-two minus ten equals seventy-two				50:40.6	50:52.9	okay so we have seventy-two equals negative eight y					50:54.4	50:57.7		so now we'd be getting rid of the negative eight				50:58.1	50:58.5	pause filler yes					50:59.2	51:03.5		so negative eight equal or negative eight plus eight equals zero				51:03.5	51:06.9		so seventy-two plus eight equals eighty				51:07.9	51:16.7	all right so y equals eighty					51:18.3	51:21.4	okay you're much better at this than me					51:22.8	51:24.0		I just do it all in my mind				51:24.9	51:25.2	yeah					51:25.2	51:32.8		for some reason I'm good at doing it less than explaining what happened				51:33.6	51:34.8	yeah I just didn't know					51:34.8	51:38.1	like when you were tutoring me I didn't know if I just do the work					51:38.1	51:38.8	or you just do the work					51:38.8	51:39.6	it was confusing (laughter) okay					51:39.6	51:42.9		so we'd have to get rid of the sixty-five first here				51:43.6	51:47.4	okay and that's being subtracted which means (inaudible)					51:47.4	51:55.0		sixty-five minus sixty-five will equals zero				51:55.0	52:06.1		than a hundred and seven minus sixty-five would equal pause filler				52:06.1	52:07.9	wouldn't that be like thirty-five					52:08.0	52:10.1		I think it's sixty-two				52:10.4	52:11.1		let me check here				52:11.1	52:20.2	well I'm recently doing like take the seven off real quick you do pause filler one hundred minus sixty-five					52:20.2	52:20.9	it's easy to do					52:20.9	52:28.4		sixty-two plus sixty-five that's not a five				52:28.4	52:35.0		I'm writing on sixty-two plus sixty-five				52:35.2	52:38.2		so no that won't be it nope (laughter)				52:38.3	52:44.2		this could be a hundred and twenty nope				52:44.2	52:47.0	so a hundred minus sixty-five					52:47.0	53:02.9		one over seven six five two bye-bye (inaudible) forty-two so forty-two				53:02.9	53:10.0	forty-two okay I'm trying to get it six to go away go away					53:10.0	53:13.8	there we go okay so you said forty-two					53:14.8	53:17.1	let's leave this with forty-two equals					53:17.3	53:21.6		fourteen x minus fourteen x okay I think it's just fourteen x				53:21.6	53:23.1	well yeah it's just fourteen x					53:23.1	53:24.9	because we already get with the minus					53:25.3	53:36.4		so fourteen x or fourteen minus fourteen so forty-two minus fourteen so I'll try to figure out				53:36.8	53:36.9	yeah					53:37.5	53:38.1		twenty-eight				53:44.4	53:45.0		twenty-eight				53:45.0	53:45.3		hmm				53:45.1	53:45.3	okay					53:45.3	53:48.8		I think (laughter) twenty-eight yeah twenty-eight				53:48.8	53:49.0	okay					53:49.1	53:50.1		why do I do this (inaudible)				53:50.3	53:53.6	see you're much better at computation					53:53.8	53:55.9	and I'm so slow at it					53:55.9	53:59.3		I just use my hands and trace it for some reason				53:59.4	54:00.2	yeah like the					54:04.5	54:04.6	okay					54:06.0	54:07.5		pretty good I made it to eight				54:08.3	54:10.8		I made it to eight this time				54:10.9	54:13.5	she did a lot better than me					54:14.6	54:18.1		so apparently I'm good at it but not explaining it				54:18.3	54:21.3	oh wait that's like					54:31.9	54:35.0		it's so cool that I've met her				54:35.0	54:36.4		I never talked to her				54:36.4	54:37.3		but I know her				54:37.3	54:38.0		that's so cool				54:49.1	54:49.3	goodbye					54:50.9	54:50.9		bye				54:51.6	54:52.3	goodbye (laughter)
