00:03:33.308,00:03:36.241,but you know since I didn't have to wake up as early,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:03:36.301,00:03:39.743,so I (inaudible) myself stay up later,,,,,,,,,,,,

00:03:50.499,00:03:53.013,,I'm at eight six o'clock I can't yet,,,,,,,,,,,
00:03:53.013,00:03:55.108,yeah because it's just so annoying entire and waking up like that,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:03:55.108,00:03:56.016,,yeah I agree,,,,,,,,,,,
00:03:56.016,00:04:05.085,I was really lucky because like other people that takes a bus for like the first stop,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:04:05.085,00:04:07.859,they have to wake up like around five so,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:04:09.266,00:04:14.933,,yeah my bus comes at like seven o four or something like that,,,,,,,,,,,
00:04:14.933,00:04:17.757,yeah my bus comes like yeah around that time,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:04:17.757,00:04:20.760,somewhere between like six fifty-five,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:04:20.779,00:04:24.461,so instead of five so usually on the earlier side on that,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:04:24.821,00:04:25.739,,so where do you live,,,,,,,,,,OSQ,
00:04:26.547,00:04:28.163,I live in Squirrel Hill,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:04:28.163,00:04:31.256,,oh okay that's pretty far away then from my house I mean,,,,,,,,,,,
00:04:31.256,00:04:33.441,,I live in pause filler I live in Imperial,,,,,,,,,,,
00:04:33.441,00:04:34.957,,do you know where the airport is,,,,,,,,,,OSQ,
00:04:35.237,00:04:35.756,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:04:35.965,00:04:38.869,,I live like a few minutes away from the airport so,,,,,,,,,,,
00:04:38.959,00:04:40.774,oh yeah that is far away,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:04:40.884,00:04:43.149,,yeah (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,

00:04:50.732,00:04:51.819,yeah because summer pause filler really,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:04:51.819,00:04:53.875,so I'm not figured out what we're going to do,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:04:53.875,00:05:01.976,but yeah we're probably going to end up going to Maryland because my grandparents are over there,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:05:02.196,00:05:02.794,,that sounds fun,,,,,,,,,,,
00:05:02.794,00:05:03.892,yeah we usually go to Colorado,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:05:04.191,00:05:07.833,but we're not sure we're going to go this year,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:05:08.382,00:05:10.836,so we need to figure that out,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:05:15.126,00:05:17.222,,so it was just warm,,,,,,,,,,,
00:05:17.222,00:05:18.568,,and then it's not even warm again,,,,,,,,,,,
00:05:18.568,00:05:19.636,,it's just cold again,,,,,,,,,,,
00:05:19.895,00:05:20.953,I know it sucks,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:05:20.953,00:05:22.240,it's like all cool,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:05:22.240,00:05:24.196,I want it to be warm,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:05:24.196,00:05:26.910,and it's like somewhat snowing outside,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:05:27.029,00:05:28.546,,it was snowing yeah,,,,,,,,,,,
00:05:28.765,00:05:29.224,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:05:29.464,00:05:32.008,,so are you excited for spring summer though,,,,,,,,,,OSQ,
00:05:33.066,00:05:35.939,yeah I can't wait just not waking up as early,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:05:36.398,00:05:40.219,,yeah the only thing I really like about winter is when it actually snows,,,,,,,,,,,
00:05:40.219,00:05:41.975,,and then it barely even snowed this winter,,,,,,,,,,,
00:05:41.975,00:05:42.464,,so I'm done,,,,,,,,,,,
00:05:42.464,00:05:46.984,I know it was just sort of like annoying like enough that you had to shovel it,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:05:47.084,00:05:49.359,but you didn't get any days off,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:05:49.608,00:05:50.057,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,
00:05:50.636,00:05:54.207,I actually got like one day off this entire winter,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:05:54.207,00:05:54.597,,yeah me too,,,,,,,,,,,
00:05:55.445,00:05:57.879,yeah but it was like not even cold out,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:05:58.528,00:06:01.690,,and I only got like two-hour delays probably,,,,,,,,,,,
00:06:01.690,00:06:04.245,yeah we didn't get yeah the same for us,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:06:04.245,00:06:08.585,it is like winter wasn't even here,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:06:09.163,00:06:09.543,,yeah (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,
00:06:09.622,00:06:15.320,,I don't know if they go to your school or not,,,,,,,,,,,
00:06:15.320,00:06:18.931,,but a couple of my friends are at Squirrel Hill and then pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,
00:06:19.001,00:06:20.777,,do you know Sophia Doyna or Trisha Soreta,,,,,,,,,,OSQ,
00:06:20.777,00:06:21.136,I (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,
00:06:21.635,00:06:26.275,,okay because I think they go to Falk,,,,,,,,,,,
00:06:26.275,00:06:28.090,,never mind (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,
00:06:29.118,00:06:29.667,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:06:38.587,00:06:48.175,,so what made you decide to do the CMU thing,,,,,,,,,,OSQ,
00:06:48.674,00:06:53.054,oh well I guess pause filler my mom works here,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:06:53.054,00:06:54.301,so she noticed it,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:06:54.381,00:06:57.933,and yeah I decided I'd do it,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:06:58.082,00:06:58.312,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,
00:06:58.621,00:06:58.970,so,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:06:59.349,00:07:02.891,,it's not too long you get money,,,,,,,,,,,
00:07:03.470,00:07:04.717,yeah money is nice,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:07:04.987,00:07:07.222,,yeah but it's a good experience also,,,,,,,,,,,
00:07:08.259,00:07:08.668,yeah (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,
00:07:16.351,00:07:17.528,,thank you,,,,,,,,,,,
00:07:17.528,00:07:18.855,I have a question,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:07:18.915,00:07:24.283,is there a way to turn this down a little bit,,,,,,,,,,,,OSQ
00:07:24.283,00:07:25.221,,all right,,,,,,,,,,,
00:07:25.221,00:07:26.328,(inaudible) all right thanks,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:08:05.830,00:28:25.390,,,T1 ,,,,,,,,,,
00:08:08.612,00:08:09.151,pause filler okay (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,
00:08:09.859,00:08:12.593,,so do you know how to do this,,,CU,,,,,,,,
00:08:12.593,00:08:13.990,,you've learned this in school right,,,,,,,,,,OSQ,
00:08:14.189,00:08:18.769,yeah so okay so yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:08:18.769,00:08:21.912,the first thing is you want to get x alone,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:08:21.912,00:08:25.055,you want to get rid of those the three over seven pause filler,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:08:26.262,00:08:35.351,,yes so then you would have to well on the sheet it was like saying that you would have to do seven x,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:08:35.351,00:08:36.908,,but I guess that's not,,,,,,,,,,,
00:08:37.496,00:08:38.265,,well never mind,,,,,,,,,,,
00:08:39.102,00:08:41.895,yeah so there's like two ways to do this,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:08:41.956,00:08:45.458,you could either divide x plus three over seven,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:08:45.458,00:08:48.352,or you could multiply it plus three over seven,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:08:49.579,00:08:52.333,,yes so you would have to divide it by three sevens,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:08:53.151,00:08:56.543,yeah or we could multiply it by the reciprocal,,,,,CF,,,,,,,
00:08:57.062,00:08:58.159,because that would also work,,,,,,,ER,,,,,
00:08:58.159,00:08:59.846,because that would turn it into one,,,,,,,ER,,,,,
00:09:00.534,00:09:01.322,,yeah yeah yeah,,,,,,,,,,,
00:09:02.041,00:09:03.398,,so what do you think,,,,,,,,,,OSQ,
00:09:03.398,00:09:04.126,,what do you,,,,,,,,,,OSQ,
00:09:05.054,00:09:08.925,pause filler I mean it all depends,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:09:09.035,00:09:11.759,would you rather divide forty or,,,,,,,,,,,,RS
00:09:11.759,00:09:13.604,would you rather multiply over forty,,,,,,,,,,,,RS
00:09:13.604,00:09:17.755,probably multiplying might be easier than dividing forty,,,,,,,ER,,,,,
00:09:17.934,00:09:20.828,,all right then teach me how to do that then,,,,,,,,,,,
00:09:22.454,00:09:27.463,okay okay that's weird oh okay yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:09:27.463,00:09:30.017,so you would want to do is,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:09:30.017,00:09:34.696,you would want to just put like forty over here,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:09:35.734,00:09:38.907,so that works,,,,,CF,,,,,,,
00:09:38.907,00:09:44.614,so you I guess you would want to write out forty if you're going to multiply that,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:09:44.863,00:09:49.543,,all right so then,,,,,,,,,,,
00:09:49.543,00:09:57.993,so then pause filler if we're going to multiply it pause filler you're going to just write over here three over seven,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:09:57.993,00:10:00.009,or seven over three yeah,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:10:00.009,00:10:01.406,and you want to do a reciprocal,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:10:01.515,00:10:01.855,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,
00:10:03.651,00:10:06.225,and I assume you know how to multiply fractions right,,,CU,,,,,,,,,CA
00:10:06.783,00:10:09.896,,I actually haven't learned this for like a year or two,,,,,,,,,,,
00:10:09.896,00:10:12.620,,so just refresh me on it,,,,,,,,,,,
00:10:12.670,00:10:16.152,,I kind of remember but,,,,,,,,,,,
00:10:16.382,00:10:19.495,so pause filler basically it's like multiplying normally except,,,,,,,EC,,,,,
00:10:19.574,00:10:25.621,you want to multiply the forty times seven and the one times three,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:10:26.149,00:10:28.384,,okay okay yeah yeah,,,,,,,,,,,
00:10:28.384,00:10:30.639,you just multiply straight across so you get,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:10:31.248,00:10:32.165,,two hundred eighty,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:10:32.804,00:10:33.223,yeah,,,,,CF,,,,,,,
00:10:36.725,00:10:40.277,,over three right,,,,,,,,,,CA,
00:10:40.277,00:10:43.729,,and then does that pause filler does that simplify,,,,,,,,,,CA,
00:10:40.443,00:10:41.106,yea,,,,,CF,,,,,,,
00:10:44.737,00:10:45.406,pause filler no,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:10:46.134,00:10:47.451,,all right,,,,,,,,,,,
00:10:46.809,00:10:47.200,no,,,,,IF,,,,,,,
00:10:47.531,00:10:51.701,see pause filler I guess you could just say that,,,,,CF,,,,,,,
00:10:52.609,00:10:58.745,because it would be okay,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:10:58.745,00:11:04.333,because you know you probably know (inaudible) okay,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:11:04.333,00:11:05.570,,all right next up,,,,,,,,,,,
00:11:05.570,00:11:09.940,,so now do you want to multiply from the reciprocal again,,,,,,,,,,CA,
00:11:10.080,00:11:11.147,,so fourteen,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:11:11.496,00:11:11.885,yeah,,,,,CF,,,,,,,
00:11:13.592,00:11:18.201,,time eight over three,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:11:19.778,00:11:22.910,,and then that's over one so fourteen times eight,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:11:24.188,00:11:25.894,,oh gosh what is fourteen times eight,,,,,,,,,,RS,
00:11:26.283,00:11:28.927,see pause filler seven time eight is fifty-six,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:11:28.927,00:11:31.890,fifty-six times two a hundred and twelve,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:11:32.429,00:11:34.205,,all right thank you,,,,,,,,,,,
00:11:34.893,00:11:36.949,,over three,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:11:37.607,00:11:37.966,yeah,,,,,CF,,,,,,,
00:11:37.966,00:11:40.261,,all right so next up,,,,,,,,,,,
00:11:42.326,00:11:43.683,,okay so,,,,,,,,,,,
00:11:45.918,00:11:51.625,okay yeah for this one this one you just have you're adding an extra step to it,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:11:51.625,00:11:55.137,so the first thing want to do is make sure y is alone on this,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:11:56.354,00:12:03.857,,all right so you're adding eighteen to both sides,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:12:04.775,00:12:09.355,,so that will equal seventy right,,,,,,,,,,CA,
00:12:09.554,00:12:09.784,pause filler yeah,,,,,CF,,,,,,,
00:12:11.500,00:12:23.283,,so seventy negative two thirds y sorry my writing is so messy equals seventy,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:12:25.229,00:12:36.124,,so you want to do seventy times wait three,,,,,,,,,,,
00:12:36.184,00:12:37.770,yeah you wanted to make sure there's a three,,,,,CF,,,,,,,
00:12:37.770,00:12:49.005,,yeah wait let me go back,,,,,,,,,,,
00:12:50.422,00:12:53.375,okay you want to just multiply,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:12:53.375,00:13:03.881,,seven times two equals (inaudible),,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:13:07.453,00:13:13.729,,and then that would equal to one hundred five,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:13:13.988,00:13:16.901,yeah maybe you could probably just put a y equals,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:13:17.550,00:13:24.384,,yeah so finally it's our y equals one hundred,,,,,A,,,,,,
00:13:24.614,00:13:27.028,except one thing you forgot to do is,,,,,IF,,,,,,,
00:13:27.028,00:13:31.708,I'm pretty sure the one o five would be a negative because yeah,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:13:32.326,00:13:34.910,you know y was a negative so,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:13:34.910,00:13:39.809,,all right next up,,,,,,,,,,,
00:13:41.505,00:13:46.324,,all right so same thing here,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:13:46.903,00:13:47.262,yeah,,,,,CF,,,,,,,
00:13:47.262,00:13:53.987,,so you would want to do minus thirteen on both sides,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:13:54.705,00:14:06.379,,and that would equal one x equals thirty-one,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:14:07.456,00:14:15.249,,then thirty-one over three times two over one equals sixty-two,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:14:15.608,00:14:15.897,yep,,,,,CF,,,,,,,
00:14:18.930,00:14:24.308,,so would it be x equals sixty-two then,,,,,,,,,,CA,
00:14:24.308,00:14:25.555,yeah as you said,,,,,CF,,,,,,,
00:14:26.144,00:14:30.524,because you can't really do you could divide it by one but that would still be a sixty-two,,,,,,,ER,,,,,
00:14:30.524,00:14:39.344,,yeah okay so this is a little bit different because it's like on the other side,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:14:39.344,00:14:41.479,,but it's still the same so,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:14:41.689,00:14:42.178,yeah,,,,,CF,,,,,,,
00:14:42.178,00:14:52.594,,add sixteen to both sides so then you I'm just going to flip this around so three,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:14:54.180,00:14:59.957,,actually I'm just going to go six over three equals,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:14:59.957,00:15:05.285,,my gosh it's not even showing up,,,,,,,,,,,
00:15:06.193,00:15:06.881,it's not,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:15:07.400,00:15:08.308,,wait one second,,,,,,,,,,,
00:15:09.166,00:15:10.872,,this tip like lagging,,,,,,,,,,,
00:15:11.800,00:15:12.249,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:15:14.315,00:15:18.315,,forty-seven over pause filler,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:15:19.642,00:15:22.875,,so then oh gosh what's six times forty-seven,,,,,,,,,,,
00:15:22.875,00:15:25.599,pause filler well one thing you could do let's see wait (inaudible),,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:15:25.599,00:15:35.965,I guess before you do that you maybe you could simplify pause filler the sixty over three to like two,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:15:36.534,00:15:37.412,that might help you,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:15:37.442,00:15:48.956,,oh yeah so three over one so forty-seven time two equals pause filler fifty-four right,,,,,,,,,,CA,
00:15:50.422,00:16:00.559,well not times two forty-seven would be eighty but mostly fourteen ninety-four because it wouldn't,,,,,IF,,,,,,,
00:16:00.559,00:16:07.324,,yeah so ninety-four and then pause filler,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:16:07.324,00:16:11.505,,that would be over that would just be ninety-four,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:16:11.505,00:16:13.620,,so x equals ninety-four,,,,,A,,,,,,
00:16:18.379,00:16:20.275,,I haven't done the reciprocal for a long time,,,,,,,,,,,
00:16:20.275,00:16:23.527,,so that's why I'm just,,,,,,,,,,,
00:16:24.894,00:16:25.533,it is fun,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:16:25.533,00:16:27.249,,so big numbers now,,,,,,,,,,,
00:16:27.339,00:16:28.496,,minus,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:16:30.691,00:16:31.010,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:16:31.429,00:16:32.607,,forty-eight so,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:16:32.607,00:16:43.003,yeah so you want to subtract,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:16:43.003,00:16:46.754,,would that be forty-nine,,,,,,,,,,CA,
00:16:47.173,00:16:47.642,yeah,,,,,CF,,,,,,,
00:16:47.642,00:16:48.680,,all right,,,,,,,,,,,
00:16:51.204,00:17:00.942,,all right so so that would be five over twelve there,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:17:00.942,00:17:01.860,yeah,,,,,CF,,,,,,,
00:17:02.229,00:17:04.823,,here I'm just going to,,,,,,,,,,,
00:17:13.493,00:17:14.082,yeah okay,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:17:14.082,00:17:16.507,and that would be a y right (inaudible),,,,,SP,,,,,,,CA
00:17:16.507,00:17:22.512,,all right so forty-nine times five,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:17:22.512,00:17:25.067,,I wish there was a calculator gosh,,,,,,,,,,,
00:17:25.166,00:17:25.786,I know,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:17:26.853,00:17:37.579,,so nine times five equals pause filler forty-five sorry forty-five,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:17:38.946,00:17:39.415,forty-five,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:17:39.415,00:17:42.617,and that equals to a hundred well,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:17:44.354,00:17:46.249,,one hundred sixty-five,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:17:47.297,00:17:48.833,no wait that wait,,,,,IF,,,,,,,
00:17:49.023,00:17:50.909,forty-five does a hundred and forty-five,,,,,SP,,,,,,,OSQ
00:17:51.048,00:17:56.376,because forty times five equals two hundred so,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:17:56.376,00:18:03.450,,are you sure it's not a hundred sixty-five,,,,,,,,,,CA,
00:18:03.450,00:18:04.987,wait maybe,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:18:04.987,00:18:08.120,oh wait yeah it's forty-nine,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:18:08.479,00:18:13.208,yeah forty-nine times five equals five okay,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:18:14.545,00:18:18.346,that's like okay so that's your five right pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,CA
00:18:19.164,00:18:20.681,so you have four over pause filler,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:18:22.088,00:18:30.239,then as you go like that because you have to have zero there,,,,,,,ER,,,,,
00:18:30.239,00:18:31.746,and that's yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:18:31.746,00:18:39.867,so it would be two hundred forty-five and pause filler five (inaudible),,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:18:39.867,00:18:42.102,,all right next page,,,,,,,,,,,
00:18:42.531,00:18:44.008,,oh gosh all right,,,,,,,,,,,
00:18:44.098,00:18:50.334,,so this one is going to be plus sixty-one to both sides,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:18:50.543,00:18:50.703,yup,,,,,CF,,,,,,,
00:18:50.703,00:18:57.018,,and then you also want to add the two ys y thing right,,,,,,,,,,CA,
00:18:57.168,00:18:58.425,,because that's like (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,
00:18:58.425,00:18:59.323,yeah so yeah,,,,,CF,,,,,,,
00:18:59.323,00:19:04.511,because there is two ones I really want one,,,,,,,ER,,,,,
00:19:04.511,00:19:07.016,,what just happened,,,,,,,,,,OSQ,
00:19:07.016,00:19:07.534,wait a minute,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:19:07.534,00:19:16.255,so would you really want to so wait which side would you want to have your y on before you do this,,,AH,,,,,,,,,
00:19:18.090,00:19:20.455,,pause filler I guess this side,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:19:20.455,00:19:22.091,,like this side over here,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:19:23.329,00:19:26.252,oh so for that you'd have to subtract the y pause filler,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:19:26.761,00:19:31.600,no so that would be harder than adding the y over here,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:19:31.600,00:19:36.339,because I guess if you add it over here then you would get pause filler,,,,,,,ER,,,,,
00:19:36.339,00:19:36.519,oh wait (inaudible),,,,,,,,,,,,
00:19:36.668,00:19:37.327,huh huh,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:19:38.215,00:19:46.197,I guess it doesn't make a difference,,,,,,,,ER,,,,
00:19:46.197,00:19:51.714,but the y would be you'd have the negative y if you do it this way,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:19:51.714,00:19:54.558,or you have a positive y if you did it that way,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:19:55.286,00:19:57.690,so that yeah it doesn't matter that much,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:19:57.910,00:19:59.017,so I guess yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:19:59.975,00:20:03.557,,just work through the first step really quick because I'm confused just,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:20:03.557,00:20:04.226,,I'm sorry,,,,,,,,,,,
00:20:05.014,00:20:07.079,yeah pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:20:07.209,00:20:14.193,yeah not subtracting sixty-one I mean this one is like a smaller one so I mean,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:20:14.193,00:20:19.451,usually we'll do the one that was smaller but it doesn't matter exactly,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:20:22.404,00:20:23.861,,well this one is smaller right,,,,,,,,,,CA,
00:20:23.901,00:20:24.709,,oh yeah so,,,,,,,,,,,
00:20:24.709,00:20:30.386,I mean when I add the sixty-five just sixty-one yeah,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:20:32.192,00:20:34.048,,all right so twenty-five,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:20:39.046,00:20:39.865,eight-six,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:20:39.954,00:20:40.274,,yeah,,,,,CF,,,,,,
00:20:54.671,00:20:55.310,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:20:55.679,00:20:57.205,,oh wait no that's equals,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:20:57.554,00:20:58.762,,oh my gosh,,,,,,,,,,,
00:20:59.360,00:20:59.969,,I'll just,,,,,,,,,,,
00:21:00.418,00:21:06.594,,and then pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,
00:21:10.026,00:21:21.480,,so then you would sub you would oh so how do you add this then,,,,,,,,,,RS,
00:21:21.480,00:21:22.228,,because it's like,,,,,,,,,,,
00:21:22.997,00:21:23.476,oh wait,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:21:23.476,00:21:28.105,so you want to get rid of the wait so now you want to subtract the y right,,,,,,,,,,,,CA
00:21:28.105,00:21:30.001,because you only have y on one side,,,,,,,ER,,,,,
00:21:30.549,00:21:32.874,and so if you got rid of that y,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:21:32.874,00:21:36.167,then you would have like a zero so,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:21:36.925,00:21:43.929,,so would that be negative six over six y then,,,,,,,,,,CA,
00:21:43.929,00:21:44.049,pause filler six,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:21:44.049,00:21:44.258,wait,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:21:45.236,00:21:53.078,,like what is going to get six over seven minus one,,,,,,,,,,,
00:21:53.078,00:21:54.844,,because y is one basically,,,,,,,ER,,,,
00:21:55.383,00:22:08.942,well so when you're subtracting that y the y pause filler is really just can be pause filler a negative seven over seven y right,,,,,,,EC,,,,,CA
00:22:08.942,00:22:19.528,so then it would just be a negative thirteen over seven y when you subtract them together,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:22:20.396,00:22:24.337,,all right,,,,,,,,,,,
00:22:24.337,00:22:24.417,,so,,,,,,,,,,,
00:22:28.887,00:22:31.142,so then once you have that y,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:22:38.465,00:22:45.639,you have that,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:22:45.639,00:22:51.525,and then you just want to multiply it by seven over thirteen,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:22:51.525,00:22:53.431,mm-hmm that's lovely,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:22:54.469,00:22:58.140,,so what's eighty-six times seven,,,,,,,,,,RS,
00:22:58.200,00:23:01.134,pause filler I don't know,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:23:01.433,00:23:07.180,okay (inaudible) okay eight six times seven two two,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:23:07.180,00:23:18.185,and for the four (inaudible) six fifty-six plus four sixty-eight pause filler,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:23:18.185,00:23:22.455,maybe six hundred and two,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:23:22.515,00:23:37.700,,all right that's so close so six hundred two and then pause filler that is over negative thirteen,,,,,,,,,,,
00:23:39.466,00:23:40.474,yeah,,,,,CF,,,,,,,
00:23:40.474,00:23:49.563,,like I'm just going to go with that you know (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,
00:23:50.481,00:23:52.537,put a little negative sign then,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:23:53.175,00:23:55.031,there we go,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:23:55.031,00:23:59.002,,all right let's move onto the next one,,,,,,,,,,,
00:23:59.002,00:24:07.882,,all right so let's just start off by adding a two,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:24:19.984,00:24:23.726,,so this cancels out then it,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:24:29.173,00:24:30.750,and then you just have,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:24:30.750,00:24:35.329,,one hundred yeah (laughter) so,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:24:33.360,00:24:33.795,yep,,,,,CF,,,,,,,
00:24:36.407,00:24:36.986,you have,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:24:38.073,00:24:41.924,,plus ten over third x,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:24:41.924,00:24:45.776,,and then negative eleven x is left over on the other side,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:24:46.354,00:24:52.890,,so now you want to add eleven x right,,,,,,,,,,CA,
00:24:53.089,00:24:59.904,,so then would that be if you're adding eleven x would that be,,,,,,,,,,RS,
00:24:59.904,00:25:09.262,pause filler wait if you're adding wait if you're adding elevenx,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:25:09.701,00:25:13.732,,would that be eleven and then ten over three,,,,,,,,,,CA,
00:25:14.830,00:25:23.470,okay if you're going to do that then on the other side you have zero equals scribble,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:25:24.578,00:25:32.450,so then you only want you want to have x on one side and the hundred on the other,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:25:32.769,00:25:36.411,so you don't want to do that,,,,,IF,,,,,,,
00:25:36.411,00:25:40.821,you would either have to pause filler put the hundred on the other side or,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:25:40.821,00:25:44.203,you would have to subtract your ten x (inaudible),,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:25:44.901,00:25:51.407,do you get that,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:25:53.173,00:25:54.190,,all right so pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,
00:25:54.190,00:26:02.042,so which one would you rather do,,,,,,,,,,,,RS
00:26:02.072,00:26:05.235,so you could either subtract a hundred,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:26:05.694,00:26:08.019,or you could subtract ten x,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:26:10.004,00:26:14.484,the ten x will probably have less steps in here because you already put a hundred on one side,,,,,SP,,ER,,,,,
00:26:14.484,00:26:17.966,,all right so subtract ten x,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:26:21.349,00:26:38.978,,so that would be negative twenty-one x equals one hundred plus three,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:26:40.884,00:26:42.670,wait wait pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:26:44.057,00:26:48.796,it doesn't look right,,,,,CF,,,,,,,
00:26:49.265,00:26:50.442,,three x or three,,,,,,,,,,,
00:26:52.647,00:27:01.228,well you pause filler wait one second sorry,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:27:01.557,00:27:03.523,,it's okay,,,,,,,,,,,
00:27:03.523,00:27:04.032,wait a minute pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:27:04.979,00:27:08.900,I'm sorry I like zoned out for a couple second wait,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:27:08.900,00:27:12.422,so you added the eleven x,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:27:12.422,00:27:15.376,is that what you ended up doing,,,,,,,,,,,,CA
00:27:19.107,00:27:26.840,,pause filler I well then you say that you could subtract ten x from both sides,,,,,,,,,,,
00:27:26.840,00:27:28.227,yeah so is that what you did,,,,,,,,,,,,CA
00:27:28.386,00:27:28.785,,yeah so,,,,,,,,,,,
00:27:28.785,00:27:28.935,okay so,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:27:28.935,00:27:34.083,,so negative twenty-one x equals one hundred plus three,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:27:34.083,00:27:34.562,no no no,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:27:34.562,00:27:39.072,so your question is would it be a negative twenty-one x,,,,,,,,,,,,CA
00:27:39.800,00:27:41.945,because you still have to divide it by three,,,,,,,EV,,,,,
00:27:41.945,00:27:42.823,so I'm pretty sure it won't,,,,,,,EV,,,,,
00:27:43.103,00:27:45.388,but yeah I'm getting confused,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:27:45.687,00:27:48.131,wait no wait no,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:27:48.131,00:27:56.442,you can't do that yeah because pause filler yeah you can't put the divided by three thing underneath that because that wouldn't work,,,,,,,EV,,,,,
00:27:58.019,00:28:01.531,so ten over three,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:28:02.628,00:28:03.776,,so you would have to,,,,,,,,,,,
00:28:03.776,00:28:12.506,so your negative eleven x because negative eleven is like over one and,,,,,,,ER,,,,,
00:28:12.606,00:28:15.140,,wouldn't you multiply it by three x probably,,,,,,,,,,,
00:28:16.587,00:28:22.334,well you're not trying to get rid well you're trying to get rid on that side by subtraction not multiplication,,,,,IF,,EV,,,,,
00:28:23.780,00:28:25.067,so what you can do,,,,,,,,,,,,RS
00:28:26.444,00:28:29.697,,It's going good,,,,,,,,,,,
00:28:33.009,00:28:33.528,,all right,,,,,,,,,,,
00:28:48.973,00:28:49.332,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,
00:28:50.809,00:28:51.218,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:28:57.703,00:28:58.342,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:29:34.330,00:35:38.060,,,S2 ,,,,,,,,,,
00:29:35.128,00:29:35.388,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,
00:29:35.966,00:29:40.087,,what did you get,,,,,,,,,,RS,
00:29:40.177,00:29:47.560,Skittles as well,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:29:47.560,00:29:51.261,I haven't had Skittles in like forever,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:29:51.820,00:29:52.429,,me neither,,,,,,,,,,,
00:29:53.666,00:30:05.040,huh that is somewhat weird,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:30:06.217,00:30:16.664,on the back it says a blue one is blue raspberry,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:30:16.664,00:30:18.420,but it doesn't say like blue raspberry,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:30:18.420,00:30:19.637,it just says raspberry,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:30:19.787,00:30:24.606,,okay so you know what like those marshmallow Peeps are right,,,,,,,,,,OSQ,
00:30:22.000,00:30:22.882,mm-hmm,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:30:24.705,00:30:27.768,,so my mom just buy pause filler Peeps,,,,,,,,,,,
00:30:27.768,00:30:30.652,,but they're blue raspberry flavored,,,,,,,,,,,
00:30:31.021,00:30:33.116,,and it was really weird,,,,,,,,,,,
00:30:33.206,00:30:34.773,it sounds weird,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:30:34.812,00:30:40.559,I should've known they're flavored Peeps,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:30:40.559,00:30:42.485,I thought they were just marshmallow flavored,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:30:42.485,00:30:42.904,,me too (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,
00:30:42.904,00:30:43.892,and sugar on top,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:30:44.251,00:30:54.198,,so until now I mean they have them for Easter Christmas Halloween every holiday basically,,,,,,,,,,,
00:30:55.954,00:31:04.395,,these are probably my new favorite type of Skittles,,,,,,,,,,,
00:31:05.523,00:31:11.020,I see,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:31:11.429,00:31:17.017,I don't really like the new green ones,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:31:17.545,00:31:18.234,,melon berry,,,,,,,,,,,
00:31:18.234,00:31:18.363,I know,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:31:18.563,00:31:28.431,okay come on see what flavor just,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:31:30.037,00:31:35.185,we got to try,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:31:35.185,00:31:36.293,there's a red one,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:31:37.161,00:31:43.417,,so would you want to go to college here,,,,,,,,,,OSQ,
00:31:44.414,00:31:47.507,pause filler I mean I think so,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:31:47.507,00:32:02.493,I don't know because there's like I mean it's a nice school,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:32:03.212,00:32:11.862,so yeah I'm not actually sure,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:32:14.057,00:32:33.982,like I'm not actually sure what I want to major in I guess so,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:32:33.982,00:32:45.565,,you don't have any idea what you want to be when you grow up,,,,,,,,,,,
00:32:47.361,00:32:49.077,somewhat but not really,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:32:50.275,00:32:51.502,,what is your somewhat idea,,,,,,,,,,OSQ,
00:32:51.502,00:32:52.520,I don't know,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:32:52.599,00:33:00.112,maybe I'm thinking maybe I'd be like a computer scientist or something like that-ish,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:33:00.751,00:33:02.267,you know I like computers,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:33:02.267,00:33:03.554,,that's cool,,,,,,,,,,,
00:33:03.944,00:33:05.261,what about you,,,,,,,,,,,,OSQ
00:33:05.290,00:33:09.671,,well as I told you last week I'm really into like theater and stuff,,,,,,,,,,,
00:33:10.139,00:33:11.267,,and I do musical theater,,,,,,,,,,,
00:33:11.267,00:33:14.170,,and I do shows and everything,,,,,,,,,,,
00:33:14.729,00:33:16.844,,and CMU is probably like one of the,,,,,,,,,,,
00:33:16.844,00:33:17.403,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:33:17.403,00:33:20.027,,it's one of the best like stuff for theater in the country,,,,,,,,,,,
00:33:20.995,00:33:24.088,,so this is like my dream school to go here for that,,,,,,,,,,,
00:33:25.784,00:33:29.086,oh yeah yeah it's sort of weird because,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:33:29.086,00:33:37.657,you don't really because you know pause filler this school it's like has a really good computer science and theater thing,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:33:37.657,00:33:39.543,which is sort of a weird combination,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:33:39.752,00:33:40.221,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,
00:33:46.966,00:33:49.570,,the purple I don't know if I really like the purple ones,,,,,,,,,,,
00:33:50.318,00:33:51.785,let's see,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:33:52.363,00:33:53.421,the red ones are okay,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:33:53.421,00:33:55.117,I don't really like the green ones,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:33:55.117,00:33:56.803,I haven't tried the purple ones yet,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:33:58.350,00:33:58.609,,heh,,,,,,,,,,,
00:34:04.925,00:34:18.734,like the ones are like best so far are the blue ones I think you know,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:34:19.143,00:34:36.344,I like the purple ones they're the best,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:34:36.743,00:34:55.978,,all of these kind of remind me of a holiday,,,,,,,,,,,
00:34:57.166,00:34:57.665,really,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:34:58.234,00:34:59.561,,I know it's kind of weird to say,,,,,,,,,,,
00:34:59.561,00:35:01.486,,but the blue ones kind of remind me of Easter,,,,,,,,,,,
00:35:01.486,00:35:08.600,,and the red ones remind me of the Valentine's day just like the taste,,,,,,,,,,,
00:35:10.187,00:35:18.448,,and the purple ones remind me Christmas,,,,,,,,,,,
00:35:18.627,00:35:22.568,the purple ones feel sort of summery,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:35:22.818,00:35:40.707,I (inaudible) the purple ones would have to taste like the fourth of July,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:35:45.766,00:35:46.095,huh,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:35:46.135,00:35:46.424,yes,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:36:00.133,00:36:02.847,,all right so first you're going to,,,,,,,,,,,
00:36:02.750,00:56:38.600,,,T2 ,,,,,,,,,,
00:36:03.246,00:36:10.210,one second I don't have that thing up,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:36:10.959,00:36:12.266,are you in Chrome,,,,,,,,,,,,OSQ
00:36:12.266,00:36:13.622,is that it,,,,,,,,,,,,OSQ
00:36:13.622,00:36:23.360,are you in Chrome for the browser,,,,,,,,,,,,OSQ
00:36:25.206,00:36:27.421,,pause filler I'm not sure,,,,,,,,,,,
00:36:28.489,00:36:29.427,one sec,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:36:30.424,00:36:31.482,oh yeah you are,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:36:31.532,00:36:38.167,but one second let me open up,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:36:38.286,00:36:38.945,so you're on,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:36:39.364,00:36:41.868,,where did the pen go,,,,,,,,,,OSQ,
00:36:42.128,00:36:42.916,,what the heck,,,,,,,,,,OSQ,
00:36:44.802,00:36:48.683,is your thing set up as one over x equals twenty-five,,,,,,,,,,,,OSQ
00:36:49.271,00:36:49.511,,yes,,,,,,,,,,,
00:36:50.559,00:36:50.728,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:36:50.728,00:36:52.614,,oh my gosh,,,,,,,,,,,
00:36:52.614,00:36:53.582,,where did the pen go,,,,,,,,,,OSQ,
00:36:56.236,00:37:19.882,,I swear I'm going insane,,,,,,,,,,,
00:37:24.980,00:37:30.817,,one second,,,,,,,,,,,
00:37:37.532,00:37:44.586,did you find it,,,,,,,,,,,,OSQ
00:37:45.204,00:37:45.793,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,
00:37:46.242,00:37:48.926,what was it,,,,,,,,,,,,OSQ
00:37:48.926,00:37:50.163,,he had the pen,,,,,,,,,,,
00:37:50.163,00:37:54.014,,he certainly grabbed it,,,,,,,,,,,
00:37:54.852,00:38:01.447,,all right so now do you know how to do this,,,,,,,,,,,
00:38:01.447,00:38:04.610,,we're going to start off by multiplying by x on both sides,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:38:05.508,00:38:12.532,okay so you multiply it by x on the (inaudible),,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:38:12.532,00:38:16.653,,well actually never mind,,,,,,,,,,,
00:38:17.182,00:38:18.030,,that was wrong,,,,,IF,,,,,,
00:38:18.030,00:38:23.038,,wait I'm looking at the tutor worksheet,,,,,,,,,,,
00:38:33.205,00:38:35.700,,yeah you do multiply both sides by x okay,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:38:35.729,00:38:41.456,okay so and so you multiply that by x,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:38:42.374,00:38:46.705,then you get one x over x,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:38:46.754,00:38:48.121,so that could be one,,,,,,,EC,,,,,
00:38:48.121,00:38:51.055,,oh yeah that would just be one no x on this side,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:38:51.055,00:38:52.920,,after you multiply on this side,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:38:52.920,00:38:54.148,,after you multiply it by x,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:38:54.148,00:38:56.662,,it pause filler it cancels out the x,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:38:56.662,00:38:59.216,,so then that would be twenty-five x,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:38:59.815,00:39:06.400,yeah so then you divide it by twenty-five on both sides,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:39:07.228,00:39:07.587,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:39:15.320,00:39:21.356,okay so then you have x equals one over twenty-five,,,,,A,,,,,,,
00:39:25.796,00:39:43.705,,all right oh you all right okay,,,,,,,,,,,
00:39:43.705,00:39:47.726,,so you want to start off by adding seventeen,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:39:47.726,00:39:48.763,,now what do you do next,,,,,,,,,,RS,
00:39:48.763,00:39:51.308,,you add a number to the sides,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:39:51.308,00:39:53.772,okay pause filler okay yeah it makes sense,,,,,CF,,,,,,,
00:39:53.772,00:39:55.917,so you just add the seventeen,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:39:59.749,00:40:02.472,and then you would get eighty,,,,,,,,,,,,CA
00:40:02.472,00:40:06.763,,yeah so negative three over y equals eighty,,,,,CF,,,,,,
00:40:11.861,00:40:14.844,,now you want to multiply it by y on both sides,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:40:14.974,00:40:24.602,okay so one pause filler negative three equals eighty-y,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:40:25.660,00:40:30.698,this you would want to divide it by y,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:40:30.698,00:40:36.675,no you would want to divide it by,,,,,IF,,,,,,,
00:40:36.675,00:40:38.051,no you would want to divide by,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:40:38.051,00:40:38.451,,eighty,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:40:38.850,00:40:39.388,eighty,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:40:39.648,00:40:52.768,so then you would get y equals negative three over eighty,,,,,A,,,,,,,
00:40:53.137,00:40:57.627,that must be okay that was this is beautiful okay,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:40:57.627,00:40:59.383,okay next,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:41:02.187,00:41:09.759,,all right so two hundred ten equals negative fourteen over y,,,,,RP,,,,,,
00:41:09.759,00:41:12.862,,what do you think your first step is going to be,,,,,,,,,,RS,
00:41:12.862,00:41:15.746,pause filler so you multiply it by y yeah,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:41:15.746,00:41:19.657,,so that cancels that out on this side,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:41:19.807,00:41:22.231,,and then you can equal two hundred ten,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:41:22.231,00:41:23.987,so you got negative yes,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:41:23.987,00:41:32.867,and then you get two hundred and ten y equals negative fourteen,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:41:33.076,00:41:43.363,okay so after you do that you pause filler want to divide everything by twenty-five,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:41:43.363,00:41:52.452,,yeah so you're left with y on one side,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:41:54.388,00:41:59.476,,because the two hundred ten is canceled out,,,,,,,ER,,,,
00:41:59.676,00:42:07.199,mm-hmm and (inaudible) you're both uh-huh with seven (inaudible),,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:42:07.658,00:42:09.005,that looks good,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:42:09.005,00:42:16.627,okay so because this one,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:42:16.627,00:42:25.318,,you want to start off by adding twenty-four to both sides,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:42:25.318,00:42:40.553,and then oh one hundred thirty-seven equals five over x,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:42:40.553,00:42:50.331,and then like the other ones you would want to multiply it by x,,,,,,,EX,,,,,
00:42:50.670,00:42:51.199,,correct,,,,,CF,,,,,,
00:42:54.392,00:43:10.585,and one hundred thirty-seven x equals five divided by hundred thirty-seven,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:43:11.313,00:43:11.672,,perfect,,,,,CF,,,,,,
00:43:11.832,00:43:26.419,yup x equals pause filler one hundred thirty-seven yeah,,,,,A,,,,,,,
00:43:26.419,00:43:28.454,,you got it,,,,,,,,,,,
00:43:29.153,00:43:30.080,yeah okay pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:43:30.180,00:43:32.754,next one,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:43:32.824,00:43:33.383,,yup,,,,,,,,,,,
00:43:35.368,00:43:35.608,pause filler yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:43:36.606,00:43:42.522,,all right oh so this is different,,,,,,,EX,,,,
00:43:42.522,00:43:43.071,yeah,,,,,CF,,,,,,,
00:43:43.071,00:43:46.513,,so you negative thirty-nine is smaller,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:43:46.513,00:43:56.630,,so you probably want to start off by adding thirty-nine to both sides,,,,,,,ER,,,,
00:43:56.810,00:43:57.827,pause filler well yeah it makes sense,,,,,CF,,,,,,,
00:44:04.931,00:44:10.559,,so remember that seventeen over x and twelve over x are like terms,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:44:10.988,00:44:17.543,,so you probably want to subtract twelve x from both sides,,,,,,,ER,,,,
00:44:18.381,00:44:20.685,yeah okay one second,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:44:20.685,00:44:22.252,let me just get this up,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:44:22.252,00:44:27.520,equals twelve x or soon not to be twelve x,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:44:27.610,00:44:33.476,oh it's twenty-one (inaudible) eighteen eighteen,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:44:33.975,00:44:45.679,we can subtract that to get pause filler five over x equals eighteen,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:44:45.998,00:44:46.886,,all right yup,,,,,,,,,,,
00:44:46.886,00:44:56.295,multiply it by x to get five pause filler equals eighteen x,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:44:56.295,00:45:04.855,and we can divide by eighteen to get on with over here pause filler,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:45:06.511,00:45:10.762,five over eighteen equals x,,,,,A,,,,,,,
00:45:10.901,00:45:16.588,that's so sloppy,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:45:16.738,00:45:17.157,and x,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:45:17.157,00:45:25.807,,all right so this one is very similar,,,,,,,EX,,,,
00:45:25.807,00:45:28.900,,so negative nine and two are smaller,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:45:28.900,00:45:31.944,,so what would you do with that,,,AH,,,,,,,RS,
00:45:31.944,00:45:38.100,pause filler so you would want to you want to add it,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:45:38.379,00:45:45.064,and you get plus another ninety-two,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:45:45.064,00:46:00.519,okay pause filler then you have three x equals pause filler a hundred and three plus twelve x,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:46:00.848,00:46:04.041,and then you want to subtract with twelve x,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:46:04.310,00:46:06.126,get rid of that until (inaudible),,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:46:06.126,00:46:08.341,,well twelve over x remember,,,,,IF,,,,,,
00:46:08.760,00:46:09.837,oh yeah (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,
00:46:10.097,00:46:13.040,,but it's okay you still subtract,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:46:13.200,00:46:13.489,here,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:46:13.489,00:46:18.488,,but you should subtract pause filler three x right three over x first,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:46:19.266,00:46:20.773,you did that one,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:46:20.773,00:46:26.889,it could be a zero equals a hundred three plus fifteen x,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:46:26.889,00:46:33.893,,no because if you're subtracting pause filler three over x on from twelve,,,,,IF,,EV,,,,
00:46:34.302,00:46:40.328,,then it would be pause filler nine over x like one hundred three,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:46:40.328,00:46:44.479,pause filler yeah one second yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:46:44.798,00:46:47.512,,oh well actually right you're right sorry,,,,,CF,,,,,,
00:46:47.512,00:46:48.450,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:46:48.450,00:46:49.627,,so you would subtract twelve x,,,,,,,ER,,,,
00:46:49.627,00:46:52.939,,because three x is on the other equal side of the,,,,,,,ER,,,,
00:46:52.939,00:46:58.926,okay so minus twelve x,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:46:58.926,00:47:07.097,yeah that's a beautiful x (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,
00:47:07.297,00:47:14.530,so then you know being negative nine yeah negative yeah twelve over x,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:47:14.530,00:47:21.115,and we got negative nine x equals a hundred and three,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:47:24.568,00:47:27.780,that makes sense,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,
00:47:27.810,00:47:29.167,okay and then,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:47:29.167,00:47:42.307,,you divide by well you said you multiply I mean,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:47:43.125,00:47:57.323,I guess you could divide right pause filler maybe,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:47:57.323,00:48:04.666,I think you could divide but pause filler multiply okay pause filler,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:48:05.864,00:48:10.064,x wait no nine equals,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:48:10.064,00:48:12.439,,how do you get your screen to go lower,,,,,,,,,,OSQ,
00:48:12.439,00:48:14.165,,because I can't see what you're doing,,,,,,,,,,,
00:48:14.165,00:48:15.651,pause filler you can't pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:48:15.651,00:48:22.167,see how far can you see to what I'm doing,,,,,,,,,,,,OSQ
00:48:24.022,00:48:25.270,,I can see,,,,,,,,,,,
00:48:25.599,00:48:29.171,here I'm going to write a bunch of numbers,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:48:29.171,00:48:30.617,tell me which ones you can see,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:48:30.617,00:48:32.014,can you see any of those,,,,,,,,,,,,OSQ
00:48:32.393,00:48:34.080,,I can see one two three and four,,,,,,,,,,,
00:48:34.459,00:48:36.754,okay so you can't see five and six pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:48:36.754,00:48:42.580,okay now I'll get rid of those pause filler okay pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:48:44.037,00:48:51.480,huh is your pause filler scribbler screen like fully like,,,,,,,,,,,,OSQ
00:48:51.480,00:48:55.052,is it from like one end to the screen all the way up to the other,,,,,,,,,,,,OSQ
00:48:56.419,00:49:01.607,,well it is now because I've just made it bigger but it's,,,,,,,,,,,
00:49:01.607,00:49:05.827,can you see nine equals one hundred threex,,,,,,,,,,,,OSQ
00:49:05.907,00:49:12.063,,pause filler yes I wait it's okay,,,,,,,,,,,
00:49:12.063,00:49:13.001,,just keep working,,,,,,,,,,,
00:49:13.001,00:49:14.598,,I can fix it,,,,,,,,,,,
00:49:16.603,00:49:17.271,,just keep working,,,,,,,,,,,
00:49:17.271,00:49:17.700,,it's okay,,,,,,,,,,,
00:49:18.259,00:49:23.577,pause filler ops one second I think pause filler oh actually a way to scroll down,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:49:23.577,00:49:28.067,you can just probably use a scroll button pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:49:28.067,00:49:30.222,no that one,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:49:30.222,00:49:31.359,like okay yeah okay pause filler yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:49:31.359,00:49:32.956,I'll just try and go with it,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:49:34.123,00:49:42.414,so then I go pause filler one hundred and three x oh (laughter) pause filler,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:49:42.833,00:49:45.078,yes you divide a hundred and three,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:49:45.078,00:49:52.402,so you got nine over a hundred and three equals x,,,,,A,,,,,,,
00:49:53.000,00:49:57.430,there we go okay,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:49:58.947,00:50:01.311,and next one,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:50:02.758,00:50:06.200,,all right so twenty-five is smaller,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:50:06.200,00:50:23.351,,so you want to start up by subtracting that from both sides right,,,,,,,,,,CA,
00:50:10.988,00:50:11.238,yea,,,,,CF,,,,,,,
00:50:23.541,00:50:23.690,pause filler yeah,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:50:23.800,00:50:24.169,come on (laughter),,,,,,,,,,,,
00:50:24.169,00:50:29.507,that's sort of like I just want to know what that looks like,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:50:29.936,00:50:46.389,then got one over x no wait and then that will be plus thirty-five equals nine over x,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:50:49.671,00:50:53.762,and then since you have that already,,,,,,,ER,,,,,
00:50:54.151,00:50:57.973,you want to get rid of the one over x,,,,,,,ER,,,,,
00:50:58.282,00:51:00.377,and it's just the bottoms all (inaudible) is,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:51:00.377,00:51:01.664,you can just subtract that,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:51:01.664,00:51:04.099,,yes so you subtract one over x on both sides,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:51:04.538,00:51:05.775,,and then you would end up with,,,,,,,,,,RS,
00:51:06.753,00:51:09.716,thirty-five equals eight overx,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:51:10.045,00:51:20.202,,so then you would want to multiply it by x on both sides to cancel out the x on this side,,,,,,,ER,,,,
00:51:20.202,00:51:24.432,well I was thinking pause filler since pause filler since the wait,,,,,,,,,MCRO,,,
00:51:24.742,00:51:27.007,you could try dividing by eight,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:51:27.007,00:51:29.641,do you think that would work,,,,,,,,,,,,HR
00:51:30.040,00:51:37.193,,well on my tutor sheet it doesn't say anything about dividing by eight so,,,,,,,,,,,
00:51:38.441,00:51:43.958,,I think you would just I think that it would just pause filler give you extra steps that you don't plan,,,,,,,EV,,,,
00:51:44.337,00:51:51.950,well maybe well I guess if you multiply if you divide it by eight when you just have x right x by itself,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:51:53.446,00:51:55.801,,no because it's dividing anyway,,,,,IF,,EV,,,,
00:51:55.801,00:51:57.966,,like eight it is divided by x anyway so pause filler,,,,,,,EV,,,,
00:51:58.665,00:52:01.049,,you would have to multiply it or something,,,,,,,EV,,,,
00:52:01.079,00:52:02.516,,but it just it's pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,
00:52:05.459,00:52:06.547,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:52:06.597,00:52:12.673,,it would be too complicated I guess,,,,,,,EV,,,,
00:52:12.673,00:52:18.869,,on all of the things it says to,,,,,,,,,,,
00:52:20.565,00:52:20.794,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:52:20.954,00:52:26.531,wait so then you get thirty-five x equals eight,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:52:26.531,00:52:30.243,or so we just divide it by thirty-five,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:52:30.243,00:52:40.579,and you get x equals like could you see that stuff on the bottom I was doing,,,,,,,,,,,,OSQ
00:52:40.579,00:52:41.158,,pause filler no I couldn't,,,,,,,,,,,
00:52:41.158,00:52:43.812,,but I can see what you're doing right now,,,,,,,,,,,
00:52:43.812,00:52:49.409,okay x equals eight over thirty-five pause filler,,,,,A,,,,,,,
00:52:49.469,00:52:57.182,but on this problem could you just draw a line at the bottom of the page that where you can see,,,,,,,,,,,,OSQ
00:52:57.182,00:52:57.890,,yeah,,,,,,,,,,,
00:53:01.063,00:53:03.178,okay that way,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:53:03.178,00:53:04.066,,all right wait,,,,,,,,,,,
00:53:04.335,00:53:08.376,okay pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:53:08.945,00:53:14.223,okay so you can see all the stuff,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:53:15.510,00:53:21.696,,all right so you're going to start off by subtracting twenty-two,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:53:22.434,00:53:29.658,and then you get a hundred and three,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:53:31.095,00:53:31.314,,yup,,,,,CF,,,,,,
00:53:31.753,00:53:36.562,plus ten x and then ninex,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:53:36.562,00:53:37.251,,okay,,,,,,,,,,,
00:53:37.251,00:53:44.953,and then pause filler yeah you're going to get rid of the tenx,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:53:45.113,00:53:48.754,,so you probably want to subtract,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:53:48.814,00:54:10.216,yeah so then you get a hundred three equals pause filler negative onex,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:54:10.216,00:54:32.395,,all right so then you want to multiply,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:54:32.395,00:54:34.800,I was just trying something out,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:54:34.800,00:54:38.581,because if you multiply that by negative one x,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:54:41.335,00:54:48.708,and then it would be negative one right over negative one x right,,,,,,,,,,,,CA
00:54:51.043,00:54:55.094,and then you could cancel out the negative one,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:54:55.942,00:54:59.554,,well if you see look at number nine on here,,,,,,,EX,,,,
00:55:00.621,00:55:03.125,,this is like a really similar problem,,,,,,,EX,,,,
00:55:03.125,00:55:04.971,,and you can kind of see what they're doing,,,,,,,EX,,,,
00:55:05.490,00:55:09.451,,it's not really like,,,,,,,EX,,,,
00:55:09.451,00:55:12.544,oh yes I mean it just seems like you would get rid of the step,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:55:12.544,00:55:15.108,but really it's just do those stuff,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:55:15.407,00:55:18.810,so you want to multiply by the x hundred and three,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:55:18.810,00:55:22.611,and you get x equals one over (inaudible),,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:55:23.719,00:55:24.547,wait okay pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:55:24.756,00:55:38.355,,well you still have to divide it by negative one,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:55:41.039,00:55:45.419,,so you multiply that on both sides and then pause filler,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:55:49.081,00:55:50.468,yeah actually you divide it,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:55:50.468,00:55:54.179,then the step would be on the other side to just divide,,,,,,,ER,,,,,
00:55:54.299,00:55:55.437,you get x by itself,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:55:55.437,00:55:57.592,and you have to divide negative three by negative one,,,,,SP,,,,,,,
00:55:58.599,00:55:59.837,,okay all right,,,,,,,,,,,
00:55:59.837,00:56:02.530,pause filler but is that the same thing,,,,,,,,,,,,OSQ
00:56:02.530,00:56:03.339,I don't think so pause filler,,,,,IF,,,,MCRO,,,
00:56:03.339,00:56:03.847,,I doubt it,,,,,,,,,,,
00:56:03.847,00:56:04.087,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:56:04.456,00:56:13.984,,all right so let's pause filler one ninety,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:56:15.381,00:56:25.758,,what's ninety what's one ninety there we go yeah,,,,,,,,,,OSQ,
00:56:25.758,00:56:30.696,,and then I would want to yeah,,,,,,,,,,,
00:56:30.806,00:56:32.911,,oh this is a big number pause filler,,,,,,,,,,,
00:56:32.911,00:56:40.295,,so you got negative five over x equals,,,,,SP,,,,,,
00:56:46.311,00:56:46.760,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:56:49.144,00:56:50.032,it's like really tiny,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:56:50.821,00:56:52.696,I don't know,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:56:52.816,00:56:57.226,I don't know what happened to it,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:57:04.809,00:57:06.026,,all right,,,,,,,,,,,
00:57:10.616,00:57:11.224,okay,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:57:15.594,00:57:15.684,bye,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:57:15.684,00:57:18.009,,all right,,,,,,,,,,,
00:57:18.378,00:57:18.707,okay bye,,,,,,,,,,,,
00:57:18.747,00:57:18.957,,bye,,,,,,,,,,,
00:57:18.957,00:57:19.336,bye,,,,,,,,,,,,
