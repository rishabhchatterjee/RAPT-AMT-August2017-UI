00:03.5,00:04.2,yeah,,,,,
00:07.5,00:07.6,okay,,,,,
00:26.2,00:26.3,yeah,,,,,

00:58.6,00:58.8,,,hey,,,
00:58.8,00:59.3,I'm Isaiah,,,SD,,
01:00.0,01:01.0,,,hi i am gage i guess is my name,,SD,hi i am gage i guess is my name
01:01.0,01:03.6,nice to meet you,,,,,
01:04.2,01:05.5,,,nice to meet you too,,,
01:05.8,01:07.6,,,what school do you go to,,QE,
01:07.7,01:09.2,pause filler I go to Allderdice,,,SD,,
01:09.2,01:10.0,Taylor Allderdice,,,,,
01:10.0,01:10.6,,,oh really,,,
01:10.7,01:11.0,yeah,,,,,
01:11.0,01:12.0,,,I'm going there next year,,SD,
01:12.6,01:13.2,oh nice,,,,,
01:13.2,01:13.8,that's awesome,,,,,
01:13.8,01:15.3,are you excited for it,,,SD,,
01:16.3,01:19.4,,,yeah it sounds like it's going to be good,,,
01:19.4,01:23.0,,,I hear it has like good program for computers right,,,
01:23.2,01:25.4,yeah they have good program for computers,,,,,
01:25.8,01:28.2,they also have a good engineering program too,,,,,
01:28.4,01:30.2,,,engineering and computers it's nice,,,
01:30.6,01:30.8,yeah,,,,,
01:31.4,01:32.9,,,things that I'm interested in,,,
01:32.9,01:33.2,nice,,,,,
01:33.5,01:35.3,that's awesome,,,,,
01:35.3,01:41.2,,,so pause filler yeah I guess we're in some sort of test test right now,,,
01:41.4,01:43.8,yeah looks like it,,,,,
01:43.8,01:46.1,,,pause filler yeah it's nice how they have a shared whiteboard,,,
01:46.1,01:46.8,,,that's cool,,,
01:47.6,01:49.6,,,that's something that I've never seen them before,,SD,
01:49.6,01:50.7,me neither,,,,,
01:52.0,01:58.9,are you pause filler going to be involved in any extra-curricular at Allderdice like sports or pause filler clubs,,,QE,,
01:59.1,02:00.5,,,probably not,,,
02:00.5,02:02.9,,,pause filler a little more introverted with my programs,,SD,
02:03.5,02:06.5,,,particularly the ones (inaudible) evolution,,,
02:06.8,02:07.6,nice,,,,,
02:08.1,02:11.4,well next year I'm pretty sure you'll be learning biology,,,,,
02:11.5,02:13.4,and on the second semester,,,,,
02:13.4,02:15.2,,,oh I'm learning biology this year too,,SD,
02:15.2,02:20.2,yeah well one of the schools I guess you need to learn it twice it's pretty interesting but,,,,,
02:20.4,02:20.7,,,yeah,,,
02:21.2,02:23.2,yeah yeah,,,,,
02:23.4,02:25.2,,,cell biology cell (inaudible),,,
02:25.8,02:33.2,,,pause filler yeah I hear it's going to be almost exactly the same as it was pause filler in middle school,,,
02:33.2,02:34.7,,,which middle school did you go to,,QE,
02:35.0,02:37.2,I pause filler did a program called Cyber School,,,SD,,
02:37.5,02:41.3,and pause filler it was just a tutoring school remotely from home,,,,,
02:41.3,02:44.1,and pause filler using like computers,,,,,
02:44.1,02:45.9,and going to like online classes,,,,,
02:45.9,02:48.2,and learning so that yeah,,,,,
02:48.8,02:49.7,,,okay cool,,,
02:49.7,02:52.5,,,would you say you know a lot about the algebra we're learning here,,SD,
02:52.5,02:56.3,pause filler I mean I don't really get them out so,,,SD,,i know a good amount so
02:56.9,03:07.3,,,yeah yeah yeah I suppose this probably works a little better with kids who are less knowledgeable about it,,,
03:07.7,03:08.0,yes,,,,,
03:08.0,03:12.9,but when it comes to advanced stuff I'm a little rusty on that but yeah,,,SD,,
03:12.9,03:16.6,,,yeah I haven't really done algebra in a while,,SD,
03:16.9,03:19.9,,,we're learning geometry this time of year pause filler,,SD,
03:21.8,03:22.7,nice,,,,,
03:24.7,03:27.1,,,yeah last year was our algebra thing,,SD,
03:27.1,03:30.0,,,have you taken keystones yet,,QE,
03:30.1,03:36.5,pause filler last week pause filler one same Thursday I did the biology keystones,,,,,
03:36.6,03:38.4,and that's was it so,,,,,
03:38.8,03:45.5,,,okay yeah our school as part of our math program we do the keystones,,,
03:45.5,03:48.8,,,pause filler just before high school,,,
03:48.8,03:51.4,,,so we don't have to deal with it then,,,
03:51.4,03:52.9,,,just have to go through now,,,
03:54.2,03:57.3,that's good to get off your chest you know,,,,,
03:57.5,04:03.1,,,factoring polynomials is really the only thing that I've lost after that time,,SD,
04:03.2,04:06.3,,,and overall it doesn't make a lot of sense to me,,,
04:06.3,04:07.4,,,I mean it make sense to me,,SD,
04:07.4,04:11.4,,,but it doesn't seem like you would use it that much,,,
04:12.3,04:17.4,,,as opposed to geometry and algebra where a lot more common,,,
04:17.4,04:22.3,,,but factoring polynomials that's all like the stuff that doesn't really tangible,,,
04:23.1,04:25.8,mm-hmm yeah yeah,,,,,
04:25.8,04:27.1,,,is there like a verb for tangibleness,,,
04:27.4,04:27.6,,,things don't tangenate,,,
04:27.6,04:28.9,(laughter) I have no clue,,,SD,,
04:28.9,04:29.1,,,yeah,,,
04:29.6,04:29.9,nice,,,,,
04:29.9,04:45.8,,,yeah well we're out of conversation topics then,,,
04:46.1,04:48.2,(laughter) won't you look at that right,,,,,
04:48.7,04:50.8,,,yup it didn't take that long at all,,,
04:50.9,04:51.2,no,,,,,
04:51.7,04:54.7,,,what do you see on your screen,,,
04:55.1,04:58.6,,,I see pause filler half of it is pause filler you and me,,,
04:58.6,05:01.8,,,and then the other half would be the desktop,,,
05:02.2,05:03.7,yup that's what I'm seeing,,,,,
05:04.2,05:05.0,it's blue pause filler,,,,,
05:05.0,05:08.6,,,see anything interesting on the desktop,,,
05:09.1,05:10.3,pause filler not really,,,,,
05:10.3,05:11.1,well there's Evernote,,,,,
05:11.4,05:13.5,it's a program,,,,,
05:13.5,05:14.9,,,I see a batch file on the desktop,,,
05:14.9,05:15.9,,,I wonder what it does,,,
05:16.8,05:19.5,pause filler let's see what else,,,,,
05:20.5,05:21.2,that's it,,,,,
05:21.7,05:22.7,I don't know,,,,,
05:22.7,05:23.7,,,does this work,,,
05:24.0,05:27.6,,,well I can't really interact with this until I get the pens,,,
05:27.6,05:30.5,,,so not a lot I can do until then,,,
05:30.5,05:31.7,seems very cool though,,,,,
05:31.7,05:32.8,they're very yeah,,,,,
05:32.8,05:40.3,,,yeah have you seen the cool robotic face recognition program that just was there,,QE,
05:40.3,05:41.1,pause filler no,,,,,
05:41.4,05:42.8,I didn't get to see that,,,,,
05:43.1,05:43.3,no,,,,,
05:43.5,05:46.6,,,it was I forgot when this was it was probably a while ago,,,
05:46.6,05:50.9,,,but there was like pause filler we were just my mom was showing me where she worked,,,
05:51.4,05:57.3,,,pause filler and we classify like this face recognition pause filler robot thing,,,
05:57.3,06:05.4,,,just recognized whether or not we are happy or sad or like making happy or sad face or,,,
06:05.4,06:07.5,,,like a surprised face I guess was the third option,,,
06:07.7,06:09.6,that's very extraordinary wow,,,,,
06:10.3,06:10.7,,,yeah,,,
06:12.0,06:15.0,yeah that's cool all right,,,,,
06:15.0,06:17.2,,,I wonder what we'll be able to do soon,,,
06:17.2,06:19.3,,,and we'll be able to go to Mars,,,
06:19.3,06:20.1,,,(inaudible),,,
06:20.1,06:28.1,yeah I feel like I'm in a kitchen right now because there's a microwave right on the table,,,,,
06:28.1,06:31.2,and behind the computer is a fridge,,,,,
06:31.8,06:35.0,and it's just a kitchen I guess,,,,,
06:35.3,06:37.5,a sink with I don't know,,,,,
06:37.5,06:41.2,I feel like I'm in the kitchen right now,,,,,
06:41.2,06:43.6,,,pause filler I am certainly in a presentation now,,,
06:43.8,06:46.7,,,there is a projector on the ceiling,,,
06:46.7,06:48.4,,,and I am surrounded by whiteboards,,,
06:48.4,06:52.0,,,I mean we won't be able to see if there's a whiteboard that way,,,
06:52.9,06:54.2,,,that way is the glass wall,,,
06:54.2,06:55.4,,,but it's supposed to be whiteboard,,,
06:55.4,06:56.4,,,and then behind me is whiteboard,,,
06:56.4,06:57.1,,,and all that is whiteboard,,,
06:58.0,07:00.3,,,and all this is whiteboard,,,
07:00.3,07:03.6,,,and there's a projector over there,,,
07:03.6,07:08.5,,,and pause filler oh yeah there is a microwave and a coffeemaker and a refrigerator,,,
07:10.4,07:10.8,nice,,,,,
07:12.6,07:13.7,,,yup,,,
07:14.0,07:16.5,did you have your day out,,,,,
07:18.2,07:22.8,,,I have all but forgotten what it was like to be outside today because I didn't pay attention,,SD,
07:22.8,07:25.1,,,mostly I just walk inside,,,
07:25.3,07:27.0,,,and pause filler now I'm here,,,
07:28.3,07:29.5,,,I don't pay attention too much,,,
07:30.1,07:31.5,,,it's kind of in the way,,,
07:33.5,07:33.9,okay,,,,,
07:34.5,07:37.4,,,and it looks like our thing is about to starty,,,
08:14.8,08:18.0,what is plain green text again,,,,,
08:25.9,08:26.7,all right great,,,,,
08:32.4,08:33.8,all right thanks,,,,,
08:34.7,19:20.6,,T1 ,,,,
08:35.0,08:35.6,all right hi,,,,,
08:35.6,08:39.0,are you ready to get this math started,,,QE,,
08:39.7,08:43.2,all right all right so pause filler,,,,,
08:43.2,08:46.8,,,I'd probably be better if this was a mouse,,SD,
08:46.8,08:53.2,,,let's see back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back,,,
08:53.2,08:54.6,,,okay I'm ready,,SD,
08:54.6,08:59.1,all right so in this equation it looks like x our variable,,,,,
09:00.6,09:01.3,oops that's,,,,,
09:01.3,09:02.9,,,yup that's the variable yup,,,
09:02.9,09:06.4,yup it's being subtracted by six and so just,,,,,
09:06.4,09:07.6,,,equals thirteen,,,
09:07.9,09:10.6,so yeah it equals thirteen so,,,,,
09:10.6,09:17.5,,,solve it because that also means if you add the six to both sides because that's how I do this,,,
09:18.0,09:18.8,,,I got it,,SD,
09:18.8,09:20.9,,,this is worse than writing on paper,,,
09:20.9,09:21.8,,,and I'm bad at this,,SD,
09:22.1,09:25.6,,,which means x equals thirteen plus,,,
09:26.1,09:27.9,,,wait that's the point,,,
09:28.8,09:29.4,,,six,,,
09:29.7,09:33.6,,,which means x equals nineteen,,,
09:34.0,09:34.5,awesome,,,,,
09:34.6,09:36.5,yup it seems like it got it,,,,,
09:36.5,09:39.9,all right and so I guess we clicked the arrow,,,,,
09:39.9,09:42.0,,,next page next,,,
09:42.6,09:42.9,perfect,,,,,
09:43.8,09:47.1,,,oh fifteen equals negative eight plus p,,,
09:47.4,09:50.0,so appears to be the same thing,,,,,
09:50.1,09:55.7,we want to add eight to get the variable one and that's,,,,,
09:55.7,10:04.1,,,yup I know we just have pause filler fifteen less eight equals p,,,
10:04.1,10:12.0,,,is that fifteen plus eight doing about (inaudible) stop working sixteen,,,
10:12.1,10:13.3,,,wait no that can't be write,,,
10:13.3,10:15.2,,,ah green work,,,
10:15.8,10:16.9,,,it's twenty-three,,,
10:16.9,10:18.6,,,there we go,,,
10:18.6,10:26.3,,,so fifteen plus eight equals twenty-three which means twenty-three equals,,,
10:26.3,10:27.1,equals p,,,,,
10:28.0,10:28.2,,,p,,,
10:28.2,10:30.6,eight seems like,,,,,
10:30.6,10:32.4,,,twenty-three let's just say that,,,
10:32.6,10:33.1,,,there we go,,,
10:33.1,10:33.9,twenty-three equals,,,,,
10:33.9,10:34.5,,,page,,,
10:35.2,10:37.6,next page there we go,,,,,
10:37.8,10:39.9,,,seventeen equals k plus eleven,,,
10:40.2,10:43.6,,,well this time we'll have to subtract from this side of stuff,,,
10:43.6,10:45.3,yup because it is being,,,,,
10:45.5,10:48.5,,,yup because this time it's pause filler here yeah,,,
10:48.8,10:55.0,,,mine is eleven so that means that pause filler six equals k,,,
10:57.1,11:00.8,,,for the next page I see them,,,
11:00.8,11:03.0,,,so forty-four x minus,,,
11:03.3,11:05.2,so forty-four (inaudible) multiply,,,,,
11:05.2,11:06.6,,,oh that's an equal sign,,,
11:06.6,11:08.4,,,I was like it just looked like minus,,,
11:08.8,11:13.1,,,oh so yup forty-four times x equals negative two twenty which means that,,,
11:13.1,11:15.5,so the opposite of it so then you would pause filler,,,,,
11:16.5,11:18.1,,,wait is that negative two twenty,,,
11:18.1,11:19.5,,,or what's going on right now,,,
11:19.5,11:23.0,pause filler I just see forty-four x equals twenty,,,,,
11:23.0,11:24.2,yeah I don't see negative,,,,,
11:24.2,11:26.4,,,the top line is kind of like weird,,,
11:26.4,11:27.1,all right,,,,,
11:27.1,11:37.2,,,so just yeah pause filler so I see we just x equals two twenty divided by forty-four,,,
11:37.2,11:38.0,,,god damn it,,,
11:38.5,11:41.5,,,which pause filler divided by two zero,,,
11:41.5,11:47.3,,,let's just say divided by yeah divided by two,,,
11:47.3,11:53.8,,,okay pause filler which means that one no one one zero,,,
11:53.8,11:55.2,,,damn it,,,
11:55.2,11:58.0,all right well we can do it,,,,,
11:58.0,11:59.3,,,divided by twenty-two,,,
11:59.3,12:00.4,if that way works for you,,,,,
12:00.4,12:01.4,we can do it that way but,,,,,
12:01.6,12:03.4,,,yeah which way do you usually do it yeah,,,
12:04.2,12:06.9,to tell you the truth I'll probably just use the calculator,,,,,
12:06.9,12:09.2,but since I don't have that,,,,,
12:09.2,12:13.3,pause filler we could set up where pause filler (inaudible) twenty,,,,,
12:14.6,12:18.1,then to go like this,,,,,
12:18.5,12:20.2,,,I mean we could factor it yeah,,,
12:21.3,12:23.0,yeah this is the longest way,,,,,
12:23.0,12:25.0,but if we could do that way or wherever way,,,,,
12:25.0,12:25.6,,,that's (inaudible) yeah pause filler,,,
12:25.7,12:28.3,but if you want to factor it go ahead,,,,,
12:29.1,12:31.0,,,let's see,,,
12:31.0,12:33.5,,,I feel like this would be a little easier on paper,,SD,
12:33.7,12:38.5,,,okay one one zero to be like fifty,,,
12:38.5,12:41.0,,,and then that would be five,,,
12:41.0,12:42.0,,,would that be fifty-five,,,
12:42.1,12:43.0,,,oh I think so,,,
12:43.2,12:45.8,,,yeah fifty-five over eleven,,,
12:45.8,12:49.8,and then we can check,,,,,
12:49.8,12:54.5,,,oh wait doesn't that just mean that it's five over five wait five,,,
12:54.5,12:56.0,I'm actually not sure,,,SD,,
12:56.3,12:57.3,,,I'm not sure either,,SD,
12:57.3,13:00.2,,,let's just say x equals five,,,
13:00.5,13:02.0,,,bam simplify everything,,,
13:02.7,13:04.6,,,let's just assume that's right,,,
13:05.5,13:10.9,,,and if all else fails x equals two twenty over forty-four,,,
13:13.8,13:14.3,all right,,,,,
13:14.3,13:15.5,,,bam close enough,,,
13:15.5,13:18.0,all right so I assume,,,,,
13:18.7,13:22.1,,,negative nine plus thirteen p equals forty-one,,,
13:22.6,13:28.7,so first step is to add the constant I think it's called,,,,,
13:29.5,13:33.5,,,yeah I guess because the quotient is this thing that you multiply by five,,,
13:33.7,13:35.1,yeah yeah the constant,,,,,
13:35.4,13:36.2,,,so yeah,,,
13:36.5,13:37.3,so both that yeah,,,,,
13:37.3,13:38.8,so add nine,,,,,
13:40.5,13:46.2,,,so then fifty equals thirteen p,,,
13:46.8,13:57.9,,,which means that p equals fifteen over thirty oh no fifty over thirteen,,,
13:57.9,13:58.3,,,correct,,,
13:59.6,14:03.4,,,which means that pause filler and you can't simplify that because p is prime,,,
14:03.4,14:04.6,,,bam next,,,
14:05.1,14:07.0,,,or because thirteen is prime,,,
14:07.1,14:07.6,perfect,,,,,
14:08.0,14:08.3,,,yup,,,
14:08.3,14:12.9,all right another same problem,,,,,
14:14.4,14:15.1,pause filler so first step,,,,,
14:16.0,14:16.9,subtract ten,,,,,
14:17.0,14:17.9,,,yeah subtract ten,,,
14:17.9,14:18.8,,,so six x,,,
14:18.8,14:20.9,just like the last one except,,,,,
14:20.9,14:23.3,,,equals twenty-four,,,
14:24.7,14:26.5,yup and then divide,,,,,
14:26.5,14:30.1,,,which means divide it by four so six,,,
14:31.1,14:33.8,,,yeah pause filler so twenty-four,,,
14:33.8,14:35.0,,,I know that's easy,,,
14:35.1,14:35.7,,,it's like four,,,
14:35.7,14:36.3,,,is that four,,,
14:36.3,14:36.8,,,I think that's four,,,
14:36.8,14:37.4,yup it's four,,,,,
14:38.0,14:40.6,,,x equals four,,,
14:41.1,14:43.0,,,so good at writing on this,,,
14:44.5,14:46.3,,,okay next,,,
14:46.8,14:47.9,,,next click,,,
14:47.9,14:48.3,,,I'm clicking,,,
14:48.3,14:49.2,,,I'm trying to click oh,,,
14:49.2,14:52.6,oh yeah I get it oh wait,,,,,
14:52.6,14:53.1,I think (inaudible),,,,,
14:53.1,14:53.8,,,yeah I think (inaudible),,,
14:54.1,14:54.3,pause filler wait,,,,,
14:54.3,14:55.2,,,there we go,,,
14:55.2,14:56.3,seven number seven,,,,,
14:56.8,14:57.4,,,seven,,,
14:57.4,14:58.8,,,there we go pause filler,,,
14:59.4,15:02.4,forty equals negative twenty-two plus fifteen k,,,,,
15:02.4,15:05.9,,,plus well first step would be to add the thing so pause filler yup,,,
15:06.1,15:09.6,yeah twenty-two to both sides,,,,,
15:09.6,15:15.6,,,sixty-two equals fifteen k yeah,,,
15:15.8,15:17.0,sixty yup,,,,,
15:17.0,15:21.2,and then you're going to want to divide fifteen k to both sides,,,,,
15:21.2,15:28.6,,,so then sixty-two divided by fifteen equals k,,,
15:28.6,15:29.4,,,yay,,,
15:30.3,15:32.1,,,pause filler can we simplify that,,,
15:32.1,15:33.0,,,I don't know,,,
15:33.0,15:36.4,,,okay I don't think so because it would have to be a five right,,,
15:36.9,15:37.2,yeah,,,,,
15:38.5,15:42.0,,,pause filler oh we won't be able to divide it by three,,,
15:42.0,15:42.7,,,but I don't care anymore,,,
15:42.8,15:47.0,,,so okay so well first is that an equals,,,
15:47.0,15:48.1,that's not a minus,,,,,
15:48.1,15:49.0,,,okay that's an equals,,,
15:49.1,15:49.9,,,there we go,,,
15:49.9,15:50.6,,,that's an equals,,,
15:51.8,15:55.4,,,pause filler thirty-three minus twelve plus seven,,,
15:57.3,16:02.4,,,so then first we'd have to pause filler minus the twelve,,,
16:03.2,16:03.9,yup,,,,,
16:03.9,16:08.3,,,so pause filler thirty-three minus twelve equals,,,
16:09.4,16:11.6,,,pause filler twenty-one,,,
16:11.6,16:15.3,,,so twenty-one equals seven x yup,,,
16:15.4,16:17.0,and then what again to do off of that,,,,,
16:17.4,16:18.7,,,seven x,,,
16:18.7,16:21.3,,,and after that I'll just that's seventy-eight,,,
16:21.5,16:23.8,,,I'm touching random buttons,,,
16:23.9,16:28.6,,,pause filler which means that pause filler x equals three because yeah,,,
16:28.6,16:31.5,because yeah seven divided by twenty-one equals three,,,,,
16:33.1,16:34.7,and we cannot simplify that anymore,,,,,
16:35.1,16:37.3,,,yup because three is just three three,,,
16:37.6,16:40.5,so this one there's pause filler we're going to do it step by step,,,,,
16:40.9,16:43.2,and we can do it like,,,,,
16:43.8,16:46.5,,,let's just subtract p first so that begins,,,
16:46.5,16:47.3,subtract p first,,,,,
16:47.5,16:48.4,that's a good,,,,,
16:48.6,16:51.9,,,fifteen equals two p yup,,,
16:51.9,16:55.1,all right and then plus twelve,,,,,
16:55.7,16:57.4,and then let's add,,,,,
16:57.6,16:58.4,,,subtract twelve right,,,
16:58.4,16:58.8,,,that would make,,,
16:58.8,16:59.6,subtract twelve,,,,,
16:59.6,17:01.2,yup that would be the next step all right,,,,,
17:01.2,17:03.4,,,yup pause filler so then subtract twelve,,,
17:03.4,17:08.1,,,it would just be three equals two p,,,
17:08.1,17:15.4,,,and that means that p equals three over two,,,
17:15.4,17:17.9,,,and we can't simplify that because both of them are prime,,,
17:18.5,17:19.0,perfect,,,,,
17:19.2,17:19.7,that's great,,,,,
17:19.9,17:20.4,,,wonderful,,,
17:22.3,17:23.4,oop I skipped one,,,,,
17:23.4,17:24.7,oops number ten,,,,,
17:25.3,17:26.4,yup last problem,,,,,
17:26.4,17:27.0,number ten,,,,,
17:27.3,17:31.7,so again we can do it we can pause filler start we can do lots of things,,,,,
17:31.7,17:34.0,but let's just start off simpl with the k,,,,,
17:34.5,17:35.8,and get that out of the way first,,,,,
17:36.4,17:38.0,,,okay so that would mean we subtract the k,,,
17:38.0,17:48.0,,,so that means that negative ten equals seven k minus sixty-eight okay,,,
17:48.1,17:48.8,yup,,,,,
17:48.8,17:50.7,,,okay bam,,,
17:51.4,17:52.5,,,that's it pause filler,,,
17:53.4,17:58.6,,,and that means that we can add sixty-eight,,,
17:58.6,17:59.8,,,so that means that pause filler,,,
17:59.8,18:00.3,,,oh crap,,,
18:00.3,18:02.9,,,what's negative ten plus sixty-eight,,,
18:02.9,18:06.3,,,it's fifty-eight okay fifty-eight,,,
18:06.3,18:06.7,,,god damn it,,,
18:06.7,18:08.7,,,I keep I'm holding this like a pencil,,,
18:08.7,18:14.0,,,so I keep pressing buttons that are weird because these things have button on the weird side,,,
18:14.6,18:18.9,,,pause filler fifty-eight equals seven k,,,
18:18.9,18:21.4,,,and fifty-eight is divisible by seven right,,,
18:21.4,18:23.1,,,now it's fifty-six right,,,
18:23.1,18:24.4,wait what did you just do pause filler with eight,,,,,
18:24.4,18:27.0,,,pause filler I added sixty-eight to both sides,,,
18:27.0,18:28.4,okay yup and yeah sixty-eight,,,,,
18:28.4,18:30.0,so then you get fifty-eight,,,,,
18:30.0,18:32.2,and then so then try to divide by seven and,,,,,
18:32.3,18:36.5,,,don't you even divide that by like I feel that's like no that's six,,,
18:36.5,18:37.9,,,I think I'm thinking of six points,,,
18:37.9,18:38.6,,,no that's eight,,,
18:38.6,18:38.8,,,oh crap,,,
18:39.1,18:40.6,,,pause filler well I know that seven is prime anyway,,,
18:40.6,18:41.4,,,so it doesn't matter all right,,,
18:41.4,18:42.8,so wait I mean let's just like count up by seven,,,,,
18:42.8,18:44.0,so three times seven twenty-one,,,,,
18:44.0,18:45.0,four times seven thirty-eight,,,,,
18:45.0,18:45.5,divide by seven,,,,,
18:45.5,18:45.9,,,thirty-five,,,
18:45.9,18:46.6,six times seven,,,,,
18:46.6,18:47.1,,,forty-two and,,,
18:47.1,18:47.7,seven times seven,,,,,
18:47.7,18:48.1,,,forty-nine,,,
18:48.1,18:48.8,,,so then fifty-six,,,
18:48.8,18:49.7,,,so yeah that's the basic form,,,
18:49.7,18:50.8,,,and this is the one more that they tell us to go,,,
18:51.3,18:52.4,,,it just accidentally broke,,,
18:52.4,18:53.7,,,sorry I'm really sorry,,,
18:53.7,18:54.8,,,pause filler I like to pay for anyone,,,
18:54.8,18:56.6,,,basically what happened was I was doodling on this board,,,
18:56.6,18:57.8,,,and I pressed down too hard,,,
18:57.8,18:58.8,,,and this thing separated here,,,
18:58.8,19:00.1,,,and I was trying to put it back together,,,
19:00.1,19:00.9,,,and it like broke up,,,
19:00.9,19:01.8,,,I like to buy a new one,,,
19:01.8,19:02.0,,,I'm sorry,,,

27:38.0,27:48.3,,,yeah and I almost feel partially responsible for making all of this weird stuff happen like the server exploding,,SD,
27:48.3,27:48.5,yeah,,,,,
27:48.5,27:48.9,,,there there there there,,,
27:48.9,27:52.7,,,why isn't it,,,
27:52.8,28:03.4,,,I'm just not even going to touch it,,,
28:04.8,28:04.9,,,aw,,,
28:06.2,28:16.1,,,they must be like trembling around like mad to try to get this fixed,,,
28:16.5,28:16.8,yeah,,,,,
28:17.2,28:17.5,,,hi,,,
28:47.9,28:55.7,,,again I'm very sorry,,,
28:55.9,28:57.6,,,I'm very sorry,,,
29:12.7,29:13.0,okay,,,,,
29:41.5,29:43.3,,,okay I'll do this okay okay,,,
29:42.9,41:56.4,,T2 ,,,,
30:04.1,30:05.6,all right thank you,,,,,
30:07.7,30:09.1,I'll skip these ten problems,,,,,
30:09.1,30:09.4,done,,,,,
30:09.4,30:11.5,all right what do we have,,,,,
30:12.0,30:15.5,,,so negative three plus the x equals the twenty-two,,,
30:15.5,30:18.1,,,well I suppose you probably know what to do,,,
30:18.1,30:21.7,,,that was a lot for me to do this number,,,
30:21.7,30:23.1,,,it's really important,,,
30:23.2,30:28.0,,,it's a really important number right there,,,
30:28.0,30:29.0,what are you doing,,,,,
30:29.5,30:30.4,,,oh crap,,,
30:30.8,30:31.7,you are curse,,,,,
30:33.7,30:36.2,,,why am I allowed to undo your Scribbles,,,
30:36.2,30:38.5,,,okay okay x equals twenty-five,,,
30:38.6,30:39.9,,,we're just going to leave it that (laughter),,,
30:40.8,30:41.5,yup that's,,,,,
30:42.5,30:44.4,,,all right negative y plus eight,,,
30:44.8,30:48.9,,,what the what am I what's going ah,,,
30:48.9,30:51.6,so I assume I want to pause filler subtract eighteen first,,,,,
30:52.2,30:53.9,,,yup or subtract the eighteen,,,
30:55.1,30:59.0,and then what do we get there pause filler,,,,,
30:59.3,30:59.8,,,well you'd get pause filler,,,
31:00.6,31:00.7,five,,,,,
31:00.8,31:03.3,,,twenty-three minus eighteen is that five,,,
31:03.3,31:05.2,,,yeah I think that is five,,,
31:05.2,31:07.3,,,the answer is five,,,
31:07.3,31:14.7,and then just multiply by negative one because you don't want a negative variable so,,,,,
31:14.9,31:18.5,,,we'll leave it y equals negative five,,,
31:18.5,31:19.9,perfect,,,,,
31:20.5,31:22.1,,,that's it,,,
31:22.1,31:23.9,oh I skipped one my bad,,,,,
31:24.4,31:27.3,,,all right negative k minus fourteen,,,
31:28.5,31:31.2,,,ah this time you have two variables,,,
31:31.2,31:33.6,,,so you'll have to like get rid of one of them,,,
31:33.7,31:35.3,,,I recommend adding it makes it easier,,,
31:35.8,31:37.1,yeah I'll add by k,,,,,
31:38.0,31:38.1,,,okay,,,
31:38.2,31:46.0,and then I get negative fourteen equals thirty-six,,,,,
31:46.5,31:49.1,,,plus two k I think all right yeah,,,
31:51.8,31:54.5,and then add fourteen,,,,,
31:55.6,31:57.0,,,pause filler you could add fourteen,,,
31:57.0,31:59.1,,,but I'd recommend subtracting them,,,
31:59.1,32:01.0,oh yeah yeah yeah mine just only do that yeah,,,,,
32:01.4,32:01.7,,,yeah,,,
32:05.5,32:07.1,and then I'm going to get,,,,,
32:08.3,32:12.2,pause filler what am I going to get here,,,,,
32:13.3,32:16.1,,,pause filler negative fifty no,,,
32:16.1,32:19.2,yeah negative fifty because yeah,,,,,
32:19.2,32:19.4,,,yup,,,
32:19.8,32:21.5,negative fifty,,,,,
32:22.9,32:24.5,,,equals two k right,,,
32:24.7,32:26.6,yup and divide,,,,,
32:27.6,32:37.6,,,by two and you like thing good five solve next,,,
32:39.0,32:40.5,pause filler again two variables,,,,,
32:40.5,32:45.0,I'll do the same thing as the last time add p,,,,,
32:45.8,32:49.3,,,so then you get two b,,,
32:49.8,32:52.2,,,or two b equals thirteen yeah,,,
32:52.3,32:54.4,then I'll subtract that,,,,,
32:54.4,32:55.2,and I get here,,,,,
32:56.4,32:58.7,,,so then you'd get four I believe,,,
32:58.8,32:59.5,oh yeah four,,,,,
32:59.6,33:00.3,oops undo,,,,,
33:05.6,33:05.8,yeah,,,,,
33:06.7,33:07.5,,,yup,,,
33:07.9,33:10.9,four equals two b,,,,,
33:11.3,33:13.5,b equals two,,,,,
33:14.2,33:14.4,,,good,,,
33:14.4,33:15.5,is that all good,,,,,
33:15.5,33:16.8,,,yup pretty sure so,,,
33:17.5,33:18.0,,,oh yeah,,,
33:20.0,33:23.6,,,I can do this thing,,,
33:23.6,33:23.9,all right pause filler,,,,,
33:23.9,33:27.1,,,negative nine g equals eighty-one huh,,,
33:27.1,33:32.1,so first I want to make the variable positive right,,,,,
33:32.8,33:33.9,,,yeah I think that's reasonable,,,
33:36.3,33:47.4,,,nine g equals eighty-one or negative eighty-one,,,
33:47.4,33:52.1,I'm just going to make that negative,,,,,
33:52.1,33:54.5,yup that's negative that's all,,,,,
33:54.5,33:54.8,,,yup (inaudible),,,
33:55.0,34:00.0,all right and then g would equal negative nine,,,,,
34:01.0,34:06.5,,,yup because you just divide it by the eighty-one,,,
34:06.5,34:07.4,exactly yup,,,,,
34:07.5,34:07.7,oops,,,,,
34:07.7,34:12.1,,,okay well skip,,,
34:12.1,34:12.4,,,okay,,,
34:12.4,34:15.6,,,so eighty-two equals negative eight y plus ten,,,
34:16.4,34:16.9,two,,,,,
34:18.4,34:20.8,is this correct,,,,,
34:20.8,34:22.3,I'm just making sure,,,,,
34:22.3,34:23.9,,,yup I think so yup pretty sure,,,
34:23.9,34:26.4,and then multiply it by negative one,,,,,
34:26.7,34:29.3,and I'm going to get myself up on this side,,,,,
34:29.3,34:40.2,so multiply equals negative just let me do divide it by eight,,,,,
34:41.5,34:44.4,and that's nine yeah,,,,,
34:45.8,34:48.3,y equals nine,,,,,
34:49.6,34:52.7,,,okay next oh try,,,
34:52.7,34:54.2,we're really good at skipping things,,,,,
34:54.9,34:58.5,,,yeah because we both go for the thing okay,,,
34:58.5,34:59.9,so,,,,,
35:00.7,35:02.3,,,because this is only one variable,,,
35:02.3,35:08.1,,,so we should just get rid of the constant on the right side or on the side with the variable or,,,
35:09.7,35:12.9,,,so pause filler a hundred seven minus sixty-five,,,
35:12.9,35:14.1,,,I'll have to do math,,,
35:14.1,35:16.3,,,oh wait no you'll have to do math uh-huh,,,
35:16.3,35:18.2,oh I have to do math,,,,,
35:19.4,35:23.3,one o seven sixty-five,,,,,
35:26.1,35:27.3,we got two,,,,,
35:27.8,35:30.8,and we got four,,,,,
35:30.8,35:33.1,oh yeah yeah oh I did that wrong,,,,,
35:33.5,35:34.4,I suck at,,,,,
35:34.7,35:36.4,,,no you did that right,,,
35:36.7,35:37.7,,,I think you did,,,
35:37.7,35:38.4,,,I'm certain you did,,,
35:38.4,35:39.5,,,yes you did,,,
35:39.6,35:40.8,,,I felt very badly,,,
35:41.3,35:44.6,yeah so yup yup yup,,,,,
35:45.4,35:46.0,pause filler forty-two,,,,,
35:46.8,35:47.5,so forty-two,,,,,
35:47.5,35:52.2,anyway we'll just do negative forty-two because we're going to multiply it by negative one,,,,,
35:52.2,35:55.9,,,yup five equals x or fourteen x,,,
35:56.2,35:57.5,equals fourteen x,,,,,
35:58.0,36:00.6,and it's three I'm guessing,,,,,
36:00.7,36:01.1,yeah x,,,,,
36:01.4,36:03.1,I'm just doing it in my head,,,,,
36:03.1,36:05.7,pause filler I guess x equals three,,,,,
36:05.7,36:11.1,,,x equals three I'm not so sure because forty-two divided by fourteen,,,
36:12.0,36:15.5,would it equal I don't feel it's not going to be two,,,,,
36:15.5,36:20.4,,,let's see I know you can turn this to seven,,,
36:20.7,36:21.0,well no,,,,,
36:21.0,36:24.7,,,yeah yeah this is pause filler twenty-one over seven,,,
36:24.8,36:27.5,,,oh which means it's one over wait one over three,,,
36:29.0,36:29.3,so,,,,,
36:29.5,36:30.6,,,no yeah I think you're right,,,
36:30.6,36:31.9,,,it is three oh wait yeah,,,
36:32.2,36:35.0,all right we could always guess and check,,,,,
36:35.0,36:36.9,but I'm pretty sure yeah,,,,,
36:37.6,36:38.7,so let's move on,,,,,
36:38.7,36:40.2,,,yeah that's three over one yup,,,
36:41.5,36:43.2,oh lots of negatives,,,,,
36:43.7,36:46.1,so let's do this first,,,,,
36:46.1,36:47.5,,,start by adding yup,,,
36:48.5,36:56.5,pause filler yeah seventy-five equals negative nine k,,,,,
36:57.6,37:06.8,and let's negative seventy nine k,,,,,
37:09.5,37:10.5,which is,,,,,
37:12.2,37:13.6,feel like,,,,,
37:16.9,37:19.1,so five right,,,,,
37:20.0,37:21.4,so k equals negative five,,,,,
37:23.4,37:25.7,,,all right wait,,,
37:25.7,37:27.8,is that correct wait no no not five,,,,,
37:27.8,37:29.4,,,is that twenty-five,,,
37:30.0,37:30.6,twenty-five,,,,,
37:31.6,37:33.6,,,can you divide twenty-five by three no,,,
37:34.9,37:36.0,well we're doing,,,,,
37:36.0,37:38.8,,,simplify it up,,,
37:38.8,37:39.4,we're doing,,,,,
37:40.5,37:43.0,negative seventy-five divided by nine,,,,,
37:43.1,37:44.1,,,well it's seventy-five,,,
37:44.1,37:45.0,,,I thought it was twenty-five,,,
37:45.8,37:46.5,yeah sorry,,,,,
37:47.2,37:49.3,seventy-five so,,,,,
37:49.3,37:54.5,,,seventy-five I think it's only seventy-five nines because I don't think you can divide it by three or anything for nine,,,
37:56.1,38:01.8,,,let's see if you divide it by nine it would be pause filler oh wait it's things line up to nine,,,
38:01.8,38:02.6,,,and they go,,,
38:02.6,38:03.3,,,so no,,,
38:04.6,38:06.0,,,and if you added it up,,,
38:06.0,38:11.6,,,and if it were divisible by three that would be divisible by three,,,
38:11.6,38:14.3,,,oh wait no it is divisible by three twenty-five,,,
38:15.1,38:16.5,so oh yeah twenty-five,,,,,
38:17.1,38:18.8,and then just do twenty so,,,,,
38:18.9,38:20.5,,,twenty-five over three,,,
38:20.5,38:21.5,twenty-five over three,,,,,
38:21.6,38:26.7,and I don't think you can simplify that anymore,,,,,
38:26.7,38:30.0,,,yeah I don't think it can get simplified any more than that,,,
38:30.0,38:30.7,,,twenty-five over three,,,
38:30.7,38:32.6,and (inaudible) really quickly just say that we,,,,,
38:33.2,38:35.9,,,yeah (inaudible) did that yup,,,
38:36.2,38:38.8,yeah something like that there,,,,,
38:39.6,38:41.1,,,say something that just looks like math,,,
38:41.1,38:42.5,,,so it looks like we did something,,,
38:42.5,38:45.4,all right pause filler so you look first,,,,,
38:45.4,38:46.9,let's add fifteen first,,,,,
38:47.9,38:55.3,,,yup again negative two equal ninety minus sixteen right,,,
38:56.8,38:57.8,yup,,,,,
38:58.2,39:01.6,,,and then you would add the sixteen,,,
39:06.1,39:07.2,exactly,,,,,
39:11.3,39:16.0,pause filler sixteen so forty-eight,,,,,
39:16.7,39:19.9,no forty-six negative forty-six,,,,,
39:20.1,39:21.9,,,no no no because they're both negative right,,,
39:22.8,39:24.9,oh yeah no no no no this is negative,,,,,
39:24.9,39:26.5,and so I'm adding it right,,,,,
39:27.5,39:28.3,,,okay you're adding it,,,
39:28.4,39:29.5,,,okay I forgot about that,,,
39:30.9,39:32.7,,,yeah then you'd be right,,,
39:32.9,39:34.4,,,so yeah it would be forty-six right,,,
39:34.4,39:35.9,,,I think so let me think (sfx),,,
39:37.0,39:39.4,wait no I don't think it's forty-six,,,,,
39:39.6,39:46.9,,,pause filler actually you would be thirty-six right because it would be thirty-six because you'd go,,,
39:46.9,39:49.2,,,yeah I think it would be thirty-six yeah,,,
39:50.4,39:54.0,yeah and so p would equal four,,,,,
39:55.9,39:59.1,,,that's yup let me just check if that's right,,,
39:59.1,40:01.3,,,the problems it's nine,,,
40:01.3,40:02.3,number nine yeah,,,,,
40:02.4,40:06.3,you can always yeah check it,,,,,
40:04.0,40:05.0,,,pause filler,,,
40:06.3,40:12.3,,,okay this thing no this isn't even the right question,,,
40:12.3,40:13.7,,,okay it's not even the right question,,,
40:13.7,40:14.8,,,okay whatever sure,,,
40:15.8,40:17.3,,,let's just say that,,,
40:20.2,40:21.4,oh boy all right,,,,,
40:21.5,40:23.2,,,this is just going to be interesting,,,
40:24.4,40:25.5,first thing's first,,,,,
40:25.7,40:28.3,,,get rid of the W weird things on both sides,,,
40:28.3,40:29.9,,,so fourteen Ws yes,,,
40:30.7,40:37.7,,,so that would mean forty w plus nineteen equals negative one forty-one,,,
40:38.1,40:39.5,,,oh my god,,,
40:41.3,40:42.1,okay wait pause filler,,,,,
40:42.3,40:45.4,,,it's forty because pause filler you add the one,,,
40:45.5,40:49.6,,,and you had the nones pause filler,,,
40:49.7,40:54.8,okay and then minus subtract I mean pause filler nineteen,,,,,
40:55.1,40:55.7,gosh,,,,,
40:57.6,40:59.1,and then it's negative,,,,,
40:59.1,41:02.8,so it's negative one sixty,,,,,
41:03.5,41:06.9,,,I really hope this data is worth a lot,,SD,
41:06.9,41:09.0,,,I hope this data is work stuff,,,
41:09.3,41:10.0,,,we work stuff data,,,
41:10.0,41:16.5,am I doing this correctly,,,,,
41:17.0,41:17.6,,,I think so,,,
41:18.2,41:18.6,,,okay,,,
41:18.6,41:25.0,,,yup one sixty and,,,
41:25.0,41:27.2,,,so you divide it by forty,,,
41:27.3,41:32.9,,,and one sixty divided four it's like wait four times,,,
41:32.9,41:35.5,I'm just going to count in my yeah,,,,,
41:35.8,41:36.3,it's four,,,,,
41:36.3,41:36.8,it's four yeah,,,,,
41:36.9,41:37.4,,,yes it's four,,,
41:37.4,41:38.7,,,yeah it's four I believe it's four,,,
41:38.7,41:41.0,,,it's negative or yeah it's negative,,,
41:41.0,41:42.2,it is negative two yeah,,,,,
41:42.6,41:42.8,,,yup,,,
41:43.1,41:43.7,negative four,,,,,
41:44.7,41:46.5,,,okay oh stop,,,
41:46.5,41:47.7,love it,,,,,
41:49.7,41:54.0,,,pause filler you want to be the one to get them or,,,
41:54.0,41:54.6,I'll do it,,,,,
41:54.6,41:56.3,,,yeah it hasn't crashed this time so,,,
41:56.4,42:00.6,,,it's always good,,,
42:02.6,42:18.2,,,pretty typical that we don't have twenty-two,,,
42:18.2,42:24.8,,,you've gone to the page that is paged,,,
42:25.7,42:25.9,,,good,,,
42:29.4,42:31.2,,,bonus round nice,,,
42:44.2,42:44.6,,,good,,,
42:50.1,42:53.5,,,well so this time we don't get the guide worksheet,,,
42:50.7,49:54.5,,T2 ,,,,
42:54.3,42:54.8,,,like whoop,,,
42:54.8,42:58.0,,,all right so we have Ys on both sides,,,
42:58.0,42:59.4,,,so we have to fix that right,,,
43:00.4,43:00.6,yeah,,,,,
43:01.5,43:08.7,,,so pause filler yeah I think we know what we're doing right,,,
43:08.7,43:09.5,yeah,,,,,
43:09.5,43:10.2,,,negative sixty-three pause filler,,,
43:10.2,43:11.0,,,so two y yup,,,
43:11.0,43:15.2,,,and then subtract the thing on that side,,,
43:15.2,43:19.7,,,you get hundred and six I think,,,
43:19.8,43:20.5,Yep,,,,,
43:20.2,43:21.6,,,yeah negative hundred six,,,
43:21.7,43:26.5,,,negative hundred six equals two y between that is y equals,,,
43:28.7,43:31.0,,,pause filler negative six divided by pause filler,,,
43:31.6,43:34.8,wait it would be like pause filler fifty-three negative fifty-three,,,,,
43:35.2,43:37.1,,,okay that would be fifty-three,,,
43:37.1,43:40.7,,,it's quite simplistic and my dear Watson,,,
43:41.2,43:48.0,,,and I'm pause filler Sherlock or whatever Sherlock Holmes,,,
43:48.7,43:54.9,,,okay pause filler this thing yes negative one eighty-two minus p equals forty-eight plus p,,,
43:54.9,43:57.4,,,so we have like the weird Ps on both sides,,,
43:58.8,44:01.2,,,forty-eight plus p two p right yeah,,,
44:01.7,44:03.7,,,let's do this,,,
44:03.7,44:08.4,,,pause filler and is that negative or no it's,,,
44:08.4,44:08.6,no,,,,,
44:09.1,44:10.1,,,yeah so it's positives,,,
44:10.1,44:11.9,,,so you just subtract it again right,,,
44:12.4,44:12.6,yeah,,,,,
44:13.1,44:15.5,,,so then on that side it would be,,,
44:15.5,44:16.0,,,negative,,,
44:16.0,44:18.3,,,it would be negative quantity,,,
44:19.0,44:21.1,wait wait wait I think I got it,,,,,
44:21.1,44:22.2,but you can go ahead,,,,,
44:22.2,44:26.0,,,it would be like negative quantity one and two plus forty-eight,,,
44:26.5,44:26.8,,,so thirty-two,,,
44:26.8,44:29.8,so negative two hundred and thirty right,,,,,
44:29.8,44:30.5,,,negative thirty,,,
44:30.5,44:31.0,,,yup there you go,,,
44:31.0,44:31.9,,,thanks,,,
44:31.9,44:33.6,,,that's really great,,,
44:33.9,44:35.3,,,negative thirty pause filler,,,
44:36.4,44:38.1,equals two p,,,,,
44:38.1,44:39.9,,,yup two p,,,
44:39.9,44:43.5,,,so then I guess you just divide the things by stuff so,,,
44:43.5,44:45.7,p would equal pause filler negative,,,,,
44:45.7,44:51.0,,,one fifteen negative one fifteen right yeah because yeah yeah,,,
44:51.0,44:53.0,wait yeah wait negative one fifteen,,,,,
44:53.0,44:55.4,,,yup because thirty-eight divided by two is fifteen,,,
44:55.4,44:59.6,,,and two hundred divided by two is a hundred,,,
44:59.6,45:01.1,wait negative,,,,,
45:01.1,45:02.0,,,yeah let me try,,,
45:02.0,45:03.0,oh negative two fifteen,,,,,
45:03.0,45:06.0,I thought you just meant negative two fifty yeah negative two fifty,,,,,
45:06.3,45:07.5,yup that's great yup,,,,,
45:07.5,45:09.6,,,one fifteen to times two,,,
45:09.6,45:14.9,,,I'm just getting zero carry to one three yeah two yeah,,,
45:14.9,45:16.1,,,good we did it,,,
45:16.8,45:17.5,,,high five,,,
45:17.5,45:20.5,,,except we can't high five because we're in like different rooms,,,
45:21.6,45:24.1,all right plus two first,,,,,
45:24.1,45:28.5,,,let's get the weird variables on the same side,,,
45:30.0,45:39.6,,,this is like algebra one o one one o one o one o one o one o one one one one one one one one one one,,,
45:39.6,45:45.7,three six I'm just going to write out like a bum,,,,,
45:46.1,45:48.3,,,yup,,,
45:48.3,45:49.2,oh my gosh,,,,,
45:50.0,45:54.2,,,so one twenty-nine then fifty-three seven three,,,
45:54.2,45:57.7,,,so it would be two,,,
45:57.7,45:59.7,,,wait yeah yeah wait wait,,,
45:59.7,46:00.6,,,is that nine,,,
46:00.9,46:01.6,it's a six,,,,,
46:01.6,46:03.3,yeah this is a nine,,,,,
46:04.1,46:08.7,,,so then yeah it wouldn't be two right because pause filler a two,,,
46:08.7,46:12.0,,,wait oh yeah I think you're multiplying,,,
46:12.0,46:12.8,,,you're multiplying,,,
46:12.8,46:14.7,oh I'm subtracting this,,,,,
46:15.1,46:15.9,,,oh you're subtracting,,,
46:16.4,46:17.4,subtracting,,,,,
46:18.4,46:19.7,,,yeah you're right you are subtracting,,,
46:20.3,46:22.6,,,so yeah you're right then it would be six and then,,,
46:22.6,46:24.3,and then eighty-six right,,,,,
46:24.7,46:25.5,,,yup I think so,,,
46:25.7,46:28.0,,,in fact I'm sure now sure,,,
46:29.1,46:29.7,,,eighty-six,,,
46:29.7,46:32.1,so eighty-six equals two g,,,,,
46:32.3,46:33.6,I think,,,,,
46:33.6,46:38.2,it's pretty nice that it's all twos I think,,,,,
46:38.2,46:38.5,,,yeah,,,
46:38.5,46:40.9,my head and I don't have to,,,,,
46:40.9,46:42.7,anyway eighty-six,,,,,
46:42.7,46:44.6,so to put that on half,,,,,
46:44.6,46:46.3,and then we get forty-three so,,,,,
46:46.3,46:50.6,,,provided we have to do this on numbers that are not stupid,,,
46:50.6,46:53.9,all right and,,,,,
46:54.2,46:55.9,pause filler this seems fun,,,,,
46:55.9,46:57.4,,,M&amp;M (inaudible) so yeah,,,
46:57.4,47:05.8,and then you can also just like do that over there so we get pause filler,,,,,
47:05.8,47:09.8,,,so we know that it'll be two M,,,
47:10.0,47:11.5,,,so we can pause filler just stop,,,
47:11.5,47:16.4,,,and is that so yeah seventy-one minus forty-three,,,
47:16.4,47:17.3,,,whatever that is,,,
47:18.3,47:21.0,,,it would be like twenty-eight,,,
47:21.0,47:26.0,,,just about the best of it I guess,,,
47:26.7,47:30.0,twenty-eight,,,,,
47:30.0,47:34.0,yup twenty-eight equals to pause filler,,,,,
47:34.0,47:38.9,,,which means that yeah,,,
47:39.9,47:40.2,pause filler wait,,,,,
47:40.3,47:46.4,,,fourteen right oh which means oh it's seven time four huh that (inaudible),,,
47:46.6,47:47.5,wait fourteen,,,,,
47:47.5,47:49.3,,,what yeah fourteen,,,
47:49.3,47:50.9,yup yup yeah fourteen,,,,,
47:55.9,47:57.5,,,it's like you addressed on the board,,,
47:57.9,47:59.0,,,you like steal it,,,
47:59.7,48:02.7,anyway pause filler let's add,,,,,
48:03.6,48:06.1,,,oh oh look we have another thing,,,
48:06.6,48:08.6,,,say yeah plus eleven x certainly,,,
48:08.6,48:16.3,,,so so that means that negative sixty-five equals seven,,,
48:16.3,48:16.6,eighteen,,,,,
48:16.8,48:26.3,,,yeah eighteen plus eighteen or seven plus eleven or seven eleven nine eleven,,,
48:26.3,48:30.9,,,pause filler yeah eighteen x minus twenty-five all right,,,
48:31.4,48:34.4,and then that would just be pause filler,,,,,
48:34.4,48:34.8,crap,,,,,
48:34.8,48:36.8,forty,,,,,
48:36.8,48:38.2,,,forty yeah,,,
48:38.4,48:39.8,negative forty negative,,,,,
48:39.8,48:41.0,,,yup negative forty mind you,,,
48:41.0,48:46.1,,,so negative are very important because I mean that's literally twice the difference,,,
48:47.2,48:47.6,,,huh two,,,
48:47.6,48:51.5,and it's eighteen,,,,,
48:51.5,48:54.5,so like eighteen,,,,,
48:55.1,48:59.3,eighteen does not go into forty so,,,,,
48:59.9,49:01.1,,,well you can divide them both by two,,,
49:01.1,49:02.4,,,so you get twenty over,,,
49:02.4,49:05.4,yeah we'll just have to simplify that out,,,,,
49:05.4,49:06.5,,,twenty over nine,,,
49:06.5,49:08.6,,,and I think that's just it twenty over nine,,,
49:09.7,49:11.7,well we can't divide it by three,,,,,
49:11.7,49:13.2,we can't divide it by four,,,,,
49:13.2,49:14.1,we can't divide it,,,,,
49:14.1,49:15.3,,,well you should divide it by four,,,
49:15.3,49:16.8,,,wait does eighteen divide by four,,,
49:18.1,49:20.2,well no four does not go into nine,,,,,
